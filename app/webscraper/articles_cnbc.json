It plans to announce the device at its annual developer conference, Google I/O, on May 10.\nThe Pixel Fold, known internally by the codename \"Felix,\" will have the \"most durable hinge on a foldable\" phone, according to the documents.

Photos viewed by CNBC show that the phone will open like a book to reveal a small tablet-sized 7.6-inch screen, the same size as the display on Samsung's competitor. It weighs 10oz, slightly heavier than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4, but it has a larger battery that Google says will last for 24 hours, or up to 72 hours in a low power mode.\nThe Pixel Fold is powered by Google's Tensor G2 chip, according to the documents. That's the same processor that\nphones last year.\nA Google spokesperson declined to comment.\nWhile hardware is a small fraction of Google’s revenue, the Pixel Fold is the most expensive phone in the company's Google Pixel family. Google has been working on the software, including Android and its app store Google Play, for third-party devices made by companies like Samsung, the current folding phone market leader.\nThe Pixel Fold will give Google a chance to show what a fully Google-made foldable phone experience is like. Other Pixels, for example, have exclusive features that aren't available on all Android phones, like photo editing options that are powered by the Tensor processor.\nThe launch comes amid questions about Google and Samsung's relationship. Earlier this week, Alphabet shares fell more than 3.5% Monday after a\nsaid Samsung is reportedly considering changing its default search engine from Google to Microsoft's Bing for its lineup of smartphones, which drives an estimated $3 billion in annual revenue to Google.\nThe Alphabet-owned company will offer incentives in a bid to convince people to switch to the Pixel Fold, according to documentation. For example, Google plans to offer a trade-in option to swap in a current Pixel, iPhone or an Android-powered phone for a discount on the Pixel Fold. It also plans to offer a\n, the company's latest smartwatch, to Pixel Fold buyers."},

Amazon is also grappling with slowing growth in its two largest businesses, retail and cloud computing, as inflation-weary consumers are more cautious about discretionary purchases and enterprises pull back on their cloud spending amid rising inflation and a worsening economic outlook.\n\"Despite growing 29% year-over-year (\"YoY\") in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companies are being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions,\" Jassy said in his letter.\n\"We have a lot more growth in front of us,\" Jassy told CNBC. \"The fact that we were able to meaningfully streamline our costs while at the same time preserving the strategic long-term investments that we believe can meaningfully change customer experiences in Amazon for the long term, I think we have a lot to look forward to.\""},

Then you're not going to be getting any opportunities to switch positions or move up at all.\"\nOlayiwola introduced a\nat last year's annual shareholders meeting, asking Amazon to stop tracking workers' rate of work and what's called \"time off task.\" The measure failed.\n\"It is a big contributor to the amount of injuries we get at Amazons worldwide,\" Olayiwola said. \"I can hands down say that. If you're rushing, you're going to make mistakes and someone's going to get hurt.\"\nOlayiwola drives a forklift to pick up heavy items in a warehouse in San Antonio, Texas. He said the slowest acceptable rate at the facility is about 22 an hour, \"meaning you'd have to pick an item every three minutes.\"\n\"Which is crazy if the item is a mirror, a dresser, a bed frame,\" Olayiwola said. \"But you have to keep picking these items and you have to drop them off at these designated drop zones.\"\nAn Amazon spokesperson said in an email that the \"pace of work\" isn't referenced in any of OSHA's citations. But the Southern DIstrict of New York's investigations at six warehouses\nas an issue. And three states —\n,\n, and\n— have passed legislation seeking to curtail the use of productivity quotas at Amazon warehouses.\nIn the meantime, Olayiwola has sought support from United for Respect, a retail worker advocacy group, and he hosts a\ncalled \"Surviving Scamazon.\" Like Crane, he wants to support his family while working to produce change from the inside. His wife is pregnant with their second child, and he calls his work at Amazon a \"necessary evil.\"\nOSHA says similar investigations are currently underway at 10 other Amazon sites, with broader investigations pending at dozens more."},

But he acknowledged those businesses have encountered some recent challenges, including a slowdown in Amazon Web Services as companies are more cautious about their cloud spend.\n\"I'm optimistic that we'll emerge from this challenging macroeconomic time in a stronger position than when we entered it,\" Jassy wrote.\nHere's the full text of Jassy's letter:\nDear shareholders:\nAs I sit down to write my second annual shareholder letter as CEO, I find myself optimistic and energized by what lies ahead for Amazon. Despite 2022 being one of the harder macroeconomic years in recent memory, and with some of our own operating challenges to boot, we still found a way to grow demand (on top of the unprecedented growth we experienced in the first half of the pandemic). We innovated in our largest businesses to meaningfully improve customer experience short and long term. And, we made important adjustments in our investment decisions and the way in which we'll invent moving forward, while still preserving the long-term investments that we believe can change the future of Amazon for customers, shareholders, and employees.\nWhile there were an unusual number of simultaneous challenges this past year, the reality is that if you operate in large, dynamic, global market segments with many capable and well-funded competitors (the conditions in which Amazon operates all of its businesses), conditions rarely stay stagnant for long.\nIn the 25 years I've been at Amazon, there has been constant change, much of which we've initiated ourselves. When I joined Amazon in 1997, we had booked $15M in revenue in 1996, were a books-only retailer, did not have a third-party marketplace, and only shipped to addresses in the US. Today, Amazon sells nearly every physical and digital retail item you can imagine, with a vibrant third-party seller ecosystem that accounts for 60% of our unit sales, and reaches customers in virtually every country around the world. Similarly, building a business around a set of technology infrastructure services in the cloud was not obvious in 2003 when we started pursuing AWS, and still wasn't when we launched our first services in 2006. Having virtually every book at your fingertips in 60 seconds, and then being able to store and retrieve them on a lightweight digital reader was not \"a thing\" yet when we launched Kindle in 2007, nor was a voice-driven personal assistant like Alexa (launched in 2014) that you could use to access entertainment, control your smart home, shop, and retrieve all sorts of information.\nThere have also been times when macroeconomic conditions or operating inefficiencies have presented us with new challenges. For instance, in the 2001 dot-com crash, we had to secure letters of credit to buy inventory for the holidays, streamline costs to deliver better profitability for the business, yet still prioritized the long-term customer experience and business we were trying to build (if you remember, we actually lowered prices in most of our categories during that tenuous 2001 period). You saw this sort of balancing again in 2008-2009 as we endured the recession provoked by the mortgage-backed securities financial crisis. We took several actions to manage the cost structure and efficiency of our Stores business, but we also balanced this streamlining with investment in customer experiences that we believed could be substantial future businesses with strong returns for shareholders. In 2008, AWS was still a fairly small, fledgling business. We knew we were on to something, but it still required substantial capital investment. There were voices inside and outside of the company questioning why Amazon (known mostly as an online retailer then) would be investing so much in cloud computing. But, we knew we were inventing something special that could create a lot of value for customers and Amazon in the future. We had a head start on potential competitors; and if anything, we wanted to accelerate our pace of innovation. We made the long-term decision to continue investing in AWS. Fifteen years later, AWS is now an $85B annual revenue run rate business, with strong profitability, that has transformed how customers from start-ups to multinational companies to public sector organizations manage their technology infrastructure. Amazon would be a different company if we'd slowed investment in AWS during that 2008-2009 period.\nChange is always around the corner. Sometimes, you proactively invite it in, and sometimes it just comes a-knocking. But, when you see it's coming, you have to embrace it. And, the companies that do this well over a long period of time usually succeed. I'm optimistic about our future prospects because I like the way our team is responding to the changes we see in front of us.\nOver the last several months,\n, invention by invention, and asked ourselves whether we had conviction about each initiative's long-term potential to drive enough revenue, operating income, free cash flow, and return on invested capital. In some cases, it led to us shuttering certain businesses. For instance, we stopped pursuing physical store concepts like our Bookstores and 4 Star stores, closed our Amazon Fabric and Amazon Care efforts, and moved on from some newer devices where we didn't see a path to meaningful returns. In other cases, we looked at some programs that weren't producing the returns we'd hoped (e.g. free shipping for all online grocery orders over $35) and amended them. We also reprioritized where to spend our resources, which ultimately led to the hard decision to eliminate 27,000 corporate roles. There are a number of other changes that we've made over the last several months to streamline our overall costs, and like most leadership teams, we'll continue to evaluate what we're seeing in our business and proceed adaptively.\nWe also looked hard at\n, beginning in May. During the pandemic, our employees rallied to get work done from home and did everything possible to keep up with the unexpected circumstances that presented themselves. It was impressive and I'm proud of the way our collective team came together to overcome unprecedented challenges for our customers, communities, and business. But, we don't think it's the best long-term approach. We've become convinced that collaborating and inventing is easier and more effective when we're working together and learning from one another in person. The energy and riffing on one another's ideas happen more freely, and many of the best Amazon inventions have had their breakthrough moments from people staying behind after a meeting and working through ideas on a whiteboard, or continuing the conversation on the walk back from a meeting, or just popping by a teammate's office later that day with another thought. Invention is often messy. It wanders and meanders and marinates. Serendipitous interactions help it, and there are more of those in-person than virtually. It's also significantly easier to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture when we're in the office together most of the time and surrounded by our colleagues. Innovation and our unique culture have been incredibly important in our first 29 years as a company, and I expect it will be comparably so in the next 29.\nA critical challenge we've continued to tackle is the rising cost to serve in our Stores fulfillment network (i.e. the cost to get a product from Amazon to a customer)—and\n.\nDuring the early part of the pandemic, with many physical stores shut down, our consumer business grew at an extraordinary clip, with annual revenue increasing from $245B in 2019 to $434B in 2022. This meant that we had to double the fulfillment center footprint that we'd built over the prior 25 years and substantially accelerate building a last-mile transportation network that's now the size of UPS (along with a new sortation center network to assist with efficiency and speed when items needed to traverse long distances)—all in the span of about two years. This was no easy feat, and hundreds of thousands of Amazonians worked very hard to make this happen. However, not surprisingly, with that rate and scale of change, there was a lot of optimization needed to yield the intended productivity. Over the last several months, we've scrutinized every process path in our fulfillment centers and transportation network and redesigned scores of processes and mechanisms, resulting in steady productivity gains and cost reductions over the last few quarters. There's more work to do, but we're pleased with our trajectory and the meaningful upside in front of us.\nWe also took this occasion to make larger structural changes that set us up better to deliver lower costs and faster speed for many years to come. A good example was reevaluating how our US fulfillment network was organized. Until recently, Amazon operated one national US fulfillment network that distributed inventory from fulfillment centers spread across the entire country. If a local fulfillment center didn't have the product a customer ordered, we'd end up shipping it from other parts of the country, costing us more and increasing delivery times. This challenge became more pronounced as our fulfillment network expanded to hundreds of additional nodes over the last few years, distributing inventory across more locations and increasing the complexity of connecting the fulfillment center and delivery station nodes efficiently. Last year, we started rearchitecting our inventory placement strategy and leveraging our larger fulfillment center footprint to move from a national fulfillment network to a regionalized network model. We made significant internal changes (e.g. placement and logistics software, processes, physical operations) to create eight interconnected regions in smaller geographic areas. Each of these regions has broad, relevant selection to operate in a largely self-sufficient way, while still being able to ship nationally when necessary. Some of the most meaningful and hard work came from optimizing the connections between this large amount of infrastructure. We also continue to improve our advanced machine learning algorithms to better predict what customers in various parts of the country will need so that we have the right inventory in the right regions at the right time. We've recently completed this regional roll out and like the early results. Shorter travel distances mean lower cost to serve, less impact on the environment, and customers getting their orders faster. On the latter, we're excited about seeing more next day and same-day deliveries, and we're on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023. Overall, we remain confident about our plans to lower costs, reduce delivery times, and build a meaningfully larger retail business with healthy operating margins.\n. Despite growing 29% year-over-year (\"YoY\") in 2022 on a $62B revenue base, AWS faces short-term headwinds right now as companies are being more cautious in spending given the challenging, current macroeconomic conditions. While some companies might obsess over how they could extract as much money from customers as possible in these tight times, it's neither what customers want nor best for customers in the long term, so we're taking a different tack. One of the many advantages of AWS and cloud computing is that when your business grows, you can seamlessly scale up; and conversely, if your business contracts, you can choose to give us back that capacity and cease paying for it. This elasticity is unique to the cloud, and doesn't exist when you've already made expensive capital investments in your own on-premises datacenters, servers, and networking gear. In AWS, like all our businesses, we're not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We're trying to build customer relationships (and a business) that outlast all of us; and as a result, our AWS sales and support teams are spending much of their time helping customers optimize their AWS spend so they can better weather this uncertain economy. Many of these AWS customers tell us that they're not cost-cutting as much as cost-optimizing so they can take their resources and apply them to emerging and inventive new customer experiences they're planning. Customers have appreciated this customer-focused, long-term approach, and we think it'll bode well for both customers and AWS.\nWhile these short-term headwinds soften our growth rate, we like a lot of the fundamentals that we're seeing in AWS. Our new customer pipeline is robust, as are our active migrations. Many companies use discontinuous periods like this to step back and determine what they strategically want to change, and we find an increasing number of enterprises opting out of managing their own infrastructure, and preferring to move to AWS to enjoy the agility, innovation, cost-efficiency, and security benefits. And most importantly for customers, AWS continues to deliver new capabilities rapidly (over 3,300 new features and services launched in 2022), and invest in long-term inventions that change what's possible.\nChip development is a good example. In last year's letter, I mentioned the investment we were making in our general-purpose CPU processors named Graviton. Graviton2-based compute instances deliver up to 40% better price-performance than the comparable latest generation x86-based instances; and in 2022, we delivered our Graviton3 chips, providing 25% better performance than the Graviton2 processors. Further, as machine learning adoption has continued to accelerate, customers have yearned for lower-cost GPUs (the chips most commonly used for machine learning). AWS started investing years ago in these specialized chips for machine learning training and inference (inferences are the predictions or answers that a machine learning model provides). We delivered our first training chip in 2022 (\"Trainium\"); and for the most common machine learning models, Trainium-based instances are up to 140% faster than GPU-based instances at up to 70% lower cost. Most companies are still in the training stage, but as they develop models that graduate to large-scale production, they'll find that most of the cost is in inference because models are trained periodically whereas inferences are happening all the time as their associated application is being exercised. We launched our first inference chips (\"Inferentia\") in 2019, and they have saved companies like Amazon over a hundred million dollars in capital expense already. Our Inferentia2 chip, which just launched, offers up to four times higher throughput and ten times lower latency than our first Inferentia processor. With the enormous upcoming growth in machine learning, customers will be able to get a lot more done with AWS's training and inference chips at a significantly lower cost. We're not close to being done innovating here, and this long-term investment should prove fruitful for both customers and AWS. AWS is still in the early stages of its evolution, and has a chance for unusual growth in the next decade.\n. Akin to physical retailers' advertising businesses selling shelf space, end-caps, and placement in their circulars, our sponsored products and brands offerings have been an integral part of the Amazon shopping experience for more than a decade. However, unlike physical retailers, Amazon can tailor these sponsored products to be relevant to what customers are searching for given what we know about shopping behaviors and our very deep investment in machine learning algorithms. This leads to advertising that's more useful for customers; and as a result, performs better for brands. This is part of why our Advertising revenue has continued to grow rapidly (23% YoY in Q4 2022, 25% YoY overall for 2022 on a $31B revenue base), even as most large advertising-focused businesses' growth have slowed over the last several quarters.\nWe strive to be the best place for advertisers to build their brands. We have near and long-term opportunities that will help us achieve that mission. We're continuing to make large investments in machine learning to keep honing our advertising selection algorithms. For the past couple of years, we've invested in building comprehensive, flexible, and durable planning and measurement solutions, giving marketers greater insight into advertising effectiveness. An example is Amazon Marketing Cloud (\"AMC\"). AMC is a \"clean room\" (i.e. secure digital environment) in which advertisers can run custom audience and campaign analytics across a range of first and third-party inputs, in a privacy-safe manner, to generate advertising and business insights to inform their broader marketing and sales strategies. The Advertising and AWS teams have collaborated to enable companies to store their data in AWS, operate securely in AMC with Amazon and other third-party data sources, perform analytics in AWS, and have the option to activate advertising on Amazon or third-party publishers through the Amazon Demand-Side Platform. Customers really like this concerted capability. We also see future opportunity to thoughtfully integrate advertising into our video, live sports, audio, and grocery products. We'll continue to work hard to help brands uniquely engage with the right audience, and grow this part of our business.\nWhile it's tempting in turbulent times only to focus on your existing large businesses, to build a sustainable, long-lasting, growing company that helps customers across a large number of dimensions, you can't stop inventing and working on long-term customer experiences that can meaningfully impact customers and your company.\nWhen we look at new investment opportunities, we ask ourselves a few questions:\nIf we like the answers to those questions, then we'll invest. This process has led to some expansions that seem straightforward, and others that some folks might not have initially guessed.\nThe earliest example is when we chose to\n, to adding categories like Music, Video, Electronics, and Toys. Back then (1998-1999), it wasn't universally applauded, but in retrospect, it seems fairly obvious.\nThe same could be said for our\n. In 2022, our international consumer segment drove $118B of revenue. In our larger, established international consumer businesses, we're big enough to be impacted by the slowing macroeconomic conditions; however, the growth in 2019-2021 on a large base was remarkable—30% compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") in the UK, 26% in Germany, and 21% in Japan (excluding the impact of FX). Over the past several years, we've invested in new international geographies, including India, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, various European countries, the Middle East, and parts of Africa. These new countries take a certain amount of fixed investment to get started and to scale, but we like the trajectory they're on, and their growth patterns resemble what we've seen in North America and our established international geographies. Emerging countries sometimes lack some of the infrastructure and services that our business relies on (e.g. payment methods, transportation services, and internet/telecom infrastructure). To solve these challenges, we continue to work with various partners to deliver solutions for customers. Ultimately, we believe that this investment in serving a broader geographical footprint will allow us to help more customers across the world, as well as build a larger free cash flow-generating consumer business.\nBeyond geographic expansion, we've been working to expand our customer offerings across some large, unique product retail market segments.\nis an $800B market segment in the US alone, with the average household shopping three to four times per week. Amazon has built a somewhat unusual, but significant grocery business over nearly 20 years. Similar to how other mass merchants entered the grocery space in the 1980s, we began by adding products typically found in supermarket aisles that don't require temperature control such as paper products, canned and boxed food, candy and snacks, pet care, health and personal care, and beauty. However, we offer more than three million items compared to a typical supermarket's 30K for the same categories. To date, we've also focused on larger pack sizes, given the current cost to serve online delivery. While we're pleased with the size and growth of our grocery business, we aspire to serve more of our customers' grocery needs than we do today. To do so, we need a broader physical store footprint given that most of the grocery shopping still happens in physical venues. Whole Foods Market pioneered the natural and organic specialty grocery store concept 40 years ago. Today, it's a large and growing business that continues to raise the bar for healthy and sustainable food. Over the past year, we've continued to invest in the business while also making changes to drive better profitability. Whole Foods is on an encouraging path, but to have a larger impact on physical grocery, we must find a mass grocery format that we believe is worth expanding broadly. Amazon Fresh is the brand we've been experimenting with for a few years, and we're working hard to identify and build the right mass grocery format for Amazon scale. Grocery is a big growth opportunity for Amazon.\nis another example of an investment where our ecommerce and logistics capabilities position us well to pursue this large market segment. Amazon Business allows businesses, municipalities, and organizations to procure products like office supplies and other bulk items easily and at great savings. While some areas of the economy have struggled over the past few years, Amazon Business has thrived. Why? Because the team has translated what it means to deliver selection, value, and convenience into a business procurement setting, constantly listening to and learning from customers, and innovating on their behalf. Some people have never heard of Amazon Business, but, our business customers love it. Amazon Business launched in 2015 and today drives roughly $35B in annualized gross sales. More than six million active customers, including 96 of the global Fortune 100 companies, are enjoying Amazon Business' one-stop shopping, real-time analytics, and broad selection on hundreds of millions of business supplies. We believe that we've only scratched the surface of what's possible to date, and plan to keep building the features our business customers tell us they need and want.\nWhile many brands and merchants successfully sell their products on Amazon's marketplace, there are also a large number of brands and sellers who have launched their own direct-to-consumer websites. One of the challenges for these merchants is driving conversion from views to purchases. We invented\nto help with this challenge. Buy with Prime allows third-party brands and sellers to offer their products on their own websites to our large Amazon Prime membership, and offer those customers fast, free Prime shipping and seamless checkout with their Amazon account. Buy with Prime provides merchants several additional benefits, including Amazon handling the product storage, picking, packing, delivery, payment, and any returns, all through Amazon Pay and Fulfillment by Amazon. Buy with Prime has recently been made available to all US merchants; and so far, Buy with Prime has increased shopper conversion on third-party shopping sites by 25% on average. Merchants are excited about converting more sales and fulfilling these shipments more easily, Prime members love that they can use their Prime benefits on more destinations, and Buy with Prime allows us to improve the shopping experience across more of the web.\nExpanding internationally, pursuing large retail market segments that are still nascent for Amazon, and using our unique assets to help merchants sell more effectively on their own websites are somewhat natural extensions for us. There are also a few investments we're making that are further from our core businesses, but where we see unique opportunity. In 2003, AWS would have been a classic example. In 2023, Amazon Healthcare and Kuiper are potential analogues.\nOur initial efforts in\nbegan with pharmacy, which felt less like a major departure from ecommerce. For years, Amazon customers had asked us when we'd offer them an online pharmacy as their frustrations mounted with current providers. Launched in 2020, Amazon Pharmacy is a full-service, online pharmacy that offers transparent pricing, easy refills, and savings for Prime members. The business is growing quickly, and continues to innovate. An example is Amazon Pharmacy's recent launch of RxPass, which for a $5 per month flat fee, enables Prime members to get as many of the eligible prescription medications as they need for dozens of common conditions, like high blood pressure, acid reflux, and anxiety. However, our customers have continued to express a strong desire for Amazon to provide a better alternative to the inefficient and unsatisfying broader healthcare experience. We decided to start with primary care as it's a prevalent first stop in the patient journey. We evaluated and studied the existing landscape extensively, including some early Amazon experiments like Amazon Care. During this process, we identified One Medical's patient-focused experience as an excellent foundation upon which to build our future business; and in July 2022, we announced our acquisition of One Medical. There are several elements that customers love about One Medical. It has a fantastic digital app that makes it easy for patients to discuss issues with a medical practitioner via chat or video conference. If a physical visit is required, One Medical has offices in cities across the US where patients can book same or next day appointments. One Medical has relationships with specialty physicians in each of its cities and works closely with local hospital systems to make seeing specialists easy, so One Medical members can quickly access these resources when needed. Going forward, we strongly believe that One Medical and Amazon will continue to innovate together to change what primary care will look like for customers.\nis another example of Amazon innovating for customers over the long term in an area where there's high customer need. Our vision for Kuiper is to create a low-Earth orbit satellite system to deliver high-quality broadband internet service to places around the world that don't currently have it. There are hundreds of millions of households and businesses who don't have reliable access to the internet. Imagine what they'll be able to do with reliable connectivity, from people taking online education courses, using financial services, starting their own businesses, doing their shopping, enjoying entertainment, to businesses and governments improving their coverage, efficiency, and operations. Kuiper will deliver not only accessibility, but affordability. Our teams have developed low-cost antennas (i.e. customer terminals) that will lower the barriers to access. We recently unveiled the new terminals that will communicate with the satellites passing overhead, and we expect to be able to produce our standard residential version for less than $400 each. They're small: 11 inches square, 1 inch thick, and weigh less than 5 pounds without their mounting bracket, but they deliver speeds up to 400 megabits per second. And they're powered by Amazon-designed baseband chips. We're preparing to launch two prototype satellites to test the entire end-to-end communications network this year, and plan to be in beta with commercial customers in 2024. The customer reaction to what we've shared thus far about Kuiper has been very positive, and we believe Kuiper represents a very large potential opportunity for Amazon. It also shares several similarities to AWS in that it's capital intensive at the start, but has a large prospective consumer, enterprise, and government customer base, significant revenue and operating profit potential, and relatively few companies with the technical and inventive aptitude, as well as the investment hypothesis to go after it.\nOne final investment area that I'll mention, that's core to setting Amazon up to invent in every area of our business for many decades to come, and where we're investing heavily is\n. Machine learning has been a technology with high promise for several decades, but it's only been the last five to ten years that it's started to be used more pervasively by companies. This shift was driven by several factors, including access to higher volumes of compute capacity at lower prices than was ever available. Amazon has been using machine learning extensively for 25 years, employing it in everything from personalized ecommerce recommendations, to fulfillment center pick paths, to drones for Prime Air, to Alexa, to the many machine learning services AWS offers (where AWS has the broadest machine learning functionality and customer base of any cloud provider). More recently, a newer form of machine learning, called Generative AI, has burst onto the scene and promises to significantly accelerate machine learning adoption. Generative AI is based on very Large Language Models (trained on up to hundreds of billions of parameters, and growing), across expansive datasets, and has radically general and broad recall and learning capabilities. We have been working on our own LLMs for a while now, believe it will transform and improve virtually every customer experience, and will continue to invest substantially in these models across all of our consumer, seller, brand, and creator experiences. Additionally, as we've done for years in AWS, we're democratizing this technology so companies of all sizes can leverage Generative AI. AWS is offering the most price-performant machine learning chips in Trainium and Inferentia so small and large companies can afford to train and run their LLMs in production. We enable companies to choose from various LLMs and build applications with all of the AWS security, privacy and other features that customers are accustomed to using. And, we're delivering applications like AWS's CodeWhisperer, which revolutionizes developer productivity by generating code suggestions in real time. I could write an entire letter on LLMs and Generative AI as I think they will be that transformative, but I'll leave that for a future letter. Let's just say that LLMs and Generative AI are going to be a big deal for customers, our shareholders, and Amazon.\nSo, in closing, I'm optimistic that we'll emerge from this challenging macroeconomic time in a stronger position than when we entered it. There are several reasons for it and I've mentioned many of them above. But, there are two relatively simple statistics that underline our immense future opportunity. While we have a consumer business that's $434B in 2022, the vast majority of total market segment share in global retail still resides in physical stores (roughly 80%). And, it's a similar story for Global IT spending, where we have AWS revenue of $80B in 2022, with about 90% of Global IT spending still on-premises and yet to migrate to the cloud. As these equations steadily flip—as we're already seeing happen—we believe our leading customer experiences, relentless invention, customer focus, and hard work will result in significant growth in the coming years. And, of course, this doesn't include the other businesses and experiences we're pursuing at Amazon, all of which are still in their early days.\nI strongly believe that our best days are in front of us, and I look forward to working with my teammates at Amazon to make it so.\nSincerely,\nAndy Jassy\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nAmazon.com, Inc.\nP.S. As we have always done, our original 1997 Shareholder Letter follows. What's written there is as true today as it was in 1997."},

And that's resulting in a series of newly-announced and coming-soon models that will make EVs much cheaper, and more mainstream, highlighted by\n's first detailed public explanation of how its next-generation car due next year will come at a lower price tag, expected to start between $25,000 and $30,000.\nThe rise of the mass-market EV will be a milestone — environmentally, economically, financially and even politically. And as the\nthat seek to aggressively remake the car market in favor of EVs more quickly than previously anticipated.\nHitting price points well\n, which Kelley Blue Book says has risen 30% in the last three years, will make obsolete the shibboleth that EVs are an elite affectation of rich people. If the new models catch on, they will cement electric transportation as a mainstream consumer good, while also making Tesla, a refocused\nand\n— and a still-to-be-winnowed out collection of EV startups — fully mainstream carmakers.\n\"For Tesla to go mass-market, they have to have a cheaper car,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who thinks Tesla's version will be a compact luxury vehicle akin to an Audi A3 gas-powered car, whose base model starts at $35,400. \"And mass market is the holy grail.\"\nTesla's lowest-priced model today is the Model 3 base MSRP of $41,990. There are currently three EV models with base MSRPs under $30,000, the Chevy Bolt, Bolt EUV, and Nissan Leaf, but average sales prices in March for both were still above $30,000, according to Edmunds, and above $34,000 in the case of the Leaf.\nLower-priced EVs are among a flood of new electric models that have begun to hit the market, with\nin the next few years.\nmodel for the European market. Startup\nplans to launch the $29,900 PEAR crossover next year in the U.S., and GM is set to ship a sub-$30,000 Chevrolet Equinox electric sport-utility vehicle by fall. Most will compete in a market for compact sedans that could hit 10 million units over five years globally, even as automakers otherwise deemphasize smaller cars to focus on SUVs, Ives said.\nAll of these prices are before the tax breaks extended in last year's Inflation Reduction Act, which let U.S. buyers take credits as large as $7,500 for most EVs made in North America, but are\n, with rules including eligibility based on where batteries are produced. There are also more\ndesigned specifically for environmentally friendly cars.\nThe rise of the budget EV raises a host of questions for car makers, including where they achieve the near-term cost savings needed from production lines, how fast they need to move to gain an edge over rivals entering the low end of the market, and whether the cost-saving techniques that EV-only companies Tesla and Fisker are claiming spread to more expensive vehicles, ultimately either lowering or containing their prices to consumers.\nBut the biggest question of all right now: what kind of EV will consumers be likely to find at these prices, and will they buy it?\n\"Think [Toyota's gasoline-powered mainstay] Corolla and other entry-level vehicles,\" said Stephanie Brinley, associate director of research at S&PGlobal Mobility. \"There's nothing wrong with having a basic car as a first car. It's a reasonable expectation to have a lower feature point.\"\nAnalysts don't expect a vehicle like Fisker's PEAR – an acronym for Personal Electric Automotive Revolution – to compete with a bigger SUV like Ford's gas-powered Explorer. Instead, the PEAR may look more like a smaller version of Honda's CRV or Toyota's RAV4, the two best-selling SUVs in the U.S. last year, according to Goodcarbadcar.net. They sell for as low as $27,500 for the RAV4, which is four inches longer than the PEAR's expected 177-inch length, and just under $30,000 for the larger CRV.\nTesla's initial low-cost car, known colloquially as a Model 2, is expected to be a hatchback, most likely made at the company's coming factory in Monterrey, Mexico, with some production possible at Tesla's Austin, Texas facility, Ives said. Likely comparable models for the next-generation Tesla and other cheap EVs include the Honda Civic or Toyota's Corolla, which retail for base prices of $25,050 and $21,550, respectively, according to Brinley. Their U.S. unit sales rank 9th and 13th among all models, and tops among compact sedans, according to Goodcarbadcar. Other similar cars include Hyundai's Kona and Honda's Fit.\nThe lowest-cost EVs may have as little as 250 miles of range between charges, similar to the existing $28,000 Nissan Leaf and cars like Hyundai's Kona that sell in the mid-$30,000-range now, letting consumers save by going for a smaller, cheaper battery, CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson said.\nBrinley says consumers are unlikely to accept less than that, and will likely insist that even less-pricey EVs keep popular safety features like lane-departure warnings. Consumers may accept a shorter range in exchange for lower cost because they use a PEAR as a second car or use it in cities, where short trips with time to recharge in between are common, Fisker CEO Henrik Fisker\nl.\n\"They may not need to carry around a giant expensive battery, if they're only using [it] as a city car,\" Fisker said. \"So we'll offer some different variations there.\"\nFor market leader Tesla, the key to pulling costs down from the $41,990 list price of the Model 3 standard range begins with new or reimagined factories, vastly greater scale and advances in battery technology, Nelson and Ives said. Ives said battery costs have another 30 to 50 percent to fall after years of decline.\nAt the No. 2 U.S. EV maker, Ford expects simple scale economies\nby 20 percentage points by 2026, according to a presentation to analysts on the company webcast on March 23. Another 25 points of margin will come from falling battery costs, and from redesigning vehicles so they can use smaller batteries, said Ford CFO John Lawler.\noutsourcing production of the PEAR to Foxconn.\nTesla devoted the biggest chunk of its March 1 investor day to explaining its next-generation strategy, which it said will drive down unit production costs that are already low by another 50%. While Elon Musk has been dogged by a history of over-promising and under-delivering — at least by the original deadline — this is a trick the company says it has already accomplished once, when moving from the premium-priced Model S and Model X vehicles to a lineup dominated now by the Model 3 and Model Y.\nThe keys include new, bigger factories and a design that makes vehicles' large, flat battery do double duty as the floor of the car. Those moves let Tesla assemble cars in a different order, skipping steps like removing doors after painting to let workers install seats and other interior components, resulting in less downtime during production, Lars Moravy, Tesla's vice president of vehicle engineering, said at the investor day. The company's new power train factories have 65% lower costs than what they replace, he added.\nTesla argues that its vertical integration, in which it designs its own batteries and much of its manufacturing equipment and software, will drive costs down further. Tesla said its overall efforts have driven the cost of drive units, which include the car's electric motor, as low as $1,000.\n\"We don't think any other automaker is even close to that number,\" vice president of drivetrain engineering Colin Campbell said, a contention backed by engineering firm Munro & Associates, which says suppliers to other automakers charge $2,500 or more for similar systems.\n\"That's big news,\" Cory Steuben, Munro president, said.\nWhile Tesla hopes the entry-level car will cement its role as a carmaker that can serve all segments of the market, automakers have spent years reducing their footprint in the less-profitable low end of the market, preferring to concentrate on larger vehicles with wider profit margins. Indeed, a spokesman for Hyundai's U.S. operation said in an e-mail that the company has no plans to introduce a lower-end EV. No low-end Fords have been announced either. GM will add the Equinox to its existing Bolt sedan, which starts at $26,500 – itself down almost $6,000 for the 2023 model year.\nthat allowed GM to surpass Ford as No. 2 behind Tesla, though still far behind, have been the Bolt.\n\"At this moment a $25,000 [battery electric vehicle] is difficult without compromising driving range,\" Hyundai said in the statement. \"Eventually, Hyundai expects ICE and BEV models to reach price parity, but the exact timing is still unclear.\"\nThe solution to low profits in lower-end electric cars, the companies hope, will be to load them with options, just as mid-priced cars and trucks do, Nelson said. In Tesla's case, this might mean battery upgrades and subscriptions to services, or even a version that lets drivers deploy the vehicle for autonomous rideshare driving while the owner stays home, Nelson added. Or automakers can simply try to sell buyers of smaller EVs on leather seats, more powerful batteries and premium stereos, counting on the same forces that make some Civic buyers pay $43,000-plus for the sportier Type R version or push some Model 3s as high as $79,000.\nOr the automakers might simply not make the new vehicles as inexpensive as they are promising now, Brinley said.\n\"Tesla hasn't hit a price point yet,\" she said.\nThe real answer depends on exactly how far costs come down, and how aggressively Tesla lowers prices, if at all, as healing supply chains and its own falling costs empower it to squeeze some of the recent inflation in car prices out of the market.\n\"Everybody is watching to see where Tesla heads,\" Ives said. \"That's going to dictate pricing and competition in the market.\""},

But the ministers agreed to prioritize steps toward phasing out \"unabated\" coal power generation — plants that do not employ mechanisms to capture emissions and prevent them from escaping into the atmosphere.\nU.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry said the meetings were \"really constructive.\"\n\"I think the unity for the goal that was expressed of phasing out unabated fossil fuels is a very important statement,\" Kerry said in an interview with The Associated Press.\nThe call to action comes as China and other developing countries step up demands for more help in phasing out fossil fuels and stabilizing energy prices and supplies amid disruptions from Russia's war on Ukraine.\nThe issue of setting a timeline for phasing out coal-fired power plants is a longstanding sticking point. Japan relies on coal for nearly one-third of its power generation and is also promoting the use of so-called clean coal, using technology to capture carbon emissions, to produce hydrogen — which produces only water when used as fuel.\nThe G-7 nations account for 40% of the world's economic activity and a quarter of global carbon emissions.

The next talks are to be held in Dubai in late November.\nChinese President Xi Jinping and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva issued a joint statement saying \"We remain very concerned that funding provided by developed countries continues to fall short of the commitment of $100 billion per year.\"\nLula met with Xi in Beijing on Friday.\nEconomic development is the first defense against climate change, Bhupender Yadav, India's environment minister, said in a tweet.\n\"The global goal of reaching net zero by 2050 needs enhanced emission descaling by developed nations,\" Yadav said, to allow the space for countries like India to develop their economies, the best defense against the impacts of climate change, environmental degradation and pollution.\"\nThe document crafted in Sapporo included significant amounts of nuance to allow for differences between the G-7 energy strategies, climate advocates said.\n\"They put out bold language on the urgency of addressing the climate crisis but the real test is what are they saying to the rest of the world about their commitments to scale up ambitions,\" Alden Meyer, a senior associate at E3G, a climate change think tank, said in a Twitter spaces session just after the communique was released.\nBut while other G-7 countries prevented Japan from expanding loopholes to allow wider use of fossil fuels, the commitments \"fall short of the clarion call to action that was needed,\" Meyer said.\nWhile the G-7 energy and environment ministers were wrapping up their meetings in Sapporo, farther south in the mountain city of Karuizawa G-7 foreign ministers were grappling with other shared concerns including regional security and the war in Ukraine.\nThe war has complicated efforts to switch to renewable energy by disrupting trade in oil and gas and pushing prices sharply higher. And it has to end for many reasons.\n\"It's insane and tragic,\" Kerry said, but phasing out carbon emissions can and must continue.\n\"I think energy security is being exaggerated in some cases,\" Kerry said, pointing to Germany's progress in embracing renewable energy."},

In a statement last week, she said, \"I intend to return as soon as possible once my medical team advises that it's safe for me to travel. In the meantime, I remain committed to the job and will continue to work from home in San Francisco.\"\nFeinstein did make one concession, agreeing to let Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ask the Senate to approve his request to let someone temporarily fill her spot on the Judiciary Committee. The panel votes on whether to advance President Joe Biden's judicial nominees.\nBut in order to fill that spot, Schumer needs either unanimous consent from senators to avoid a vote, or else 10 Republicans to vote with Democrats to break a filibuster.\nAs of Monday, several Republican senators had already announced they would not green light a replacement by unanimous consent. The odds of 10 Republicans crossing party lines to help Democrats also looked bleak.\nSpeaking to reporters in Washington, Schumer said he was still optimistic that Republicans would help him fill Feinstein's committee spot, and he intended to put it to a vote this week.

Ron DeSantis to\nwhether he'll run for the White House. Longshot candidate Republican Vivek Ramaswamy, in contrast, loaned over $10 million to his campaign in the first quarter and relied on about $1 million in contributions from others, including at least half a dozen wealthy donors, according to his campaign filings.\nBoth Haley and Ramaswamy are trailing former President Donald Trump, according to the latest public polls. A Fox News\ntaken in late March shows Haley with 3% of support from Republican voters, with Ramaswamy holding at 1%. Trump had 54% of participants' support, with DeSantis picking up 24%.

The joint fundraising committee finished raising over $4.3 million, while the Haley campaign itself brought in around $5.1 million, according to FEC records. Team Stand for America transferred about $1.8 million to the Haley campaign on March 31, according to the records.\nHamm, the executive chairman of oil and natural gas company Continental Resources, donated $16,600 to Team Stand for America last month, according to the filing. Hamm supported former President Donald Trump during the 2016 election and later backed the Trump endorsed Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz. He told the Financial Times in an\npublished last year that he didn't think Trump should run again in 2024.\n\"Loyalty's a big thing with us — it's very necessary with leaders,\" Hamm told the FT. \"And I wish Trump could have been a lot more loyal to his people.\" The former president overlooked Hamm to become Energy secretary in his administration, the FT said.\nHamm and his family are worth a combined $18.5 billion, according to Forbes.\nHamm isn't the only previous Trump ally turning to help Haley. Former Trump White House lawyer Ty Cobb, who\nlast year that the former president was a \"deeply wounded narcissist,\" donated $5,000 to the Haley joint fundraising committee.\nLeonard Stern, the CEO of real estate firm Hartz Mountain Industries, contributed the same amount as Hamm to Team Stand for America in March. Forbes says he has a net worth of $7.6 billion.\nStern, Cobb and a spokeswoman for Hamm did not return requests for comment before publication.\nThe support for Haley indicates a growing desire among donors to back a candidate who can beat Biden in 2024, according to one of Haley's top supporters. Haley seems to be making an appeal to more moderate Republicans while drawing a contrast with Trump. Since she\nher candidacy in February, Haley became the\ndeclared 2024 candidate to visit the southern border to tout her immigration plan.\n\"If you take a look at the makeup of the donors at this stage in the game, you have people who are Republican donors that are often involved in presidential elections who see her as a viable candidate that won't just win in the primary but also in the general election,\" said Ozzie Palomo, a co-founder of lobbying firm Chartwell Strategy Group and a Haley fundraiser.\nOther wealthy donors moving to back Haley include Davis, chairman of shoe company New Balance, who donated $16,600 to the joint fundraising committee in late March. Davis and his family, which own nearly all of New Balance, have a net worth of $4.9 billion,\n.\nA New Balance spokeswoman did not return requests for comment.\non Wall Street also played a role in helping Haley's fundraising surge.\nBourkoff, the CEO of investment giant LionTree, contributed $16,600 to Team Stand for America last month. Bourkoff has a history of donating to Democrats running for office, including to Vice President Kamala Harris' 2020 campaign and Biden's successful run for the White House, according to data from the nonpartisan OpenSecrets. Bourkoff did not return a request for comment.\nJim Haskel, a partner at hedge fund behemoth Bridgewater Associates, gave the same amount to the committee in February.\nExecutives from Goldman Sachs, Susquehanna International Group, UBS Group and Tiger Management, are among the other Wall Street leaders who donated to the Haley joint fundraising committee in the first quarter."},

I think it's unique in the business, and I think that differs from what you see from some of the competition as well,\" Curtis said.\nBurger rival\nhas had much-publicized spats with its operators over the years. Recently, tension has been boiling over changes to its\n.\nBefore Burger King announced its official turnaround strategy, the company spent roughly a year simplifying operations with a goal to improve efficiency and order accuracy, Curtis said. For example, Burger King reformulated and renamed its chicken sandwich. The now-retired\ninvolved 21 steps to prepare the final menu item. The Royal Crispy Chicken sandwich takes just five.\nAfter announcing its \"Reclaim the Flame\" strategy at a franchisee convention in September, Burger King turned its attention to an in-store training program for all of its restaurants that instructed workers to greet customers, make Whoppers properly and give out Burger King's iconic crowns. Curtis said it was \"the most important thing that we did coming out of the convention.\"\nBurger King also held roundtables for general managers in 45 cities. Those roundtables included training general managers on how to execute a five-week-long deep clean of their restaurants.\n\"I think those things are foundationally important, and they resulted in a 20% uplift in guest satisfaction,\" Curtis said.\nAdditionally, Burger King launched its \"You Rule\" marketing campaign in the fall. The chain's mascot, the Burger King, is nowhere to be seen in the ads. Instead, customers are royalty.\nAnd despite Curtis' own initial misgivings about the \"Whopper Whopper\" jingle used in the campaign (he was underwhelmed by the lyrics and asked the marketing team to rethink it), the song\nand spawned memes across Twitter and TikTok. The company officially released the song in response to the popularity, and it has nearly 3.3 million streams on Spotify as of Friday.\n\"We're selling more Whoppers than we ever have. It's had a really positive impact that we didn't pay for or foresee on the business ... it's really exceeded my expectations,\" Curtis said, adding that he's excited for Restaurant Brands to release its earnings.\nSince the company announced its \"Reclaim the Flame\" strategy, former\nCEO Patrick Doyle has joined Restaurant Brands as its\n. Doyle oversaw the pizza chain's transformation into a digital powerhouse in the restaurant industry. Curtis, who started as a Domino's franchisee, worked alongside Doyle during his long career at Domino's as an operations executive before joining Burger King in 2021.\nOne of Doyle's priorities for Burger King has been improving franchisee profitability. Two Burger King franchisees have filed for bankruptcy so far in 2023. The first franchisee to file for bankruptcy, Toms King Holdings, sold most of its locations at auction for $33 million earlier in April.\n\"I don't want to say that it's welcome, because it's not, but I do think that if managed correctly, the outcome can be better than where you were before,\" Curtis said.\nWhile early signs point to the turnaround taking hold, Curtis is deferring the victory lap for now, emphasizing that \"Reclaim the Flame\" is meant to be a multiyear growth strategy.\nFor example, of the $50 million that Restaurant Brands earmarked to improve restaurants' appearances in conjunction with franchisees' own investment, Burger King spent just $15 million in 2022.\n\"We're not even halfway, and these things just take time,\" Curtis said."},

Shipments coming directly from China represented about $80 million worth of goods, while Malaysia accounted for $461 million and Vietnam accounted for $370 million.

Then, she examined the fibers under a microscope to see if they were made from cotton. Next, the shirts were sent out to a private lab overseas for isotope analysis that can determine whether the cotton was grown in the Xinjiang region.\n\"We really have to drill down into the chemical makeup of cotton,\" said Stephen Cassata, senior science officer at CBP. \"It creates kind of a fingerprint for that particular region.\"\nThe isotope analysis is so precise that scientists can pinpoint the exact geographic location of where the cotton originated from – from one side of a river to the other side of a river, according to Cassata.\nCBP asked CNBC not to reveal the names of any corporation that had items detained because the information was protected by the\n, which says disclosing it could impact CBP's ability to enforce the law as well as the company's reputation.\nOfficials sent detention notices to the manufacturers, explaining that merchandise was being held.

If the company cannot prove within a 30-day period that its products have no ties to forced labor, then the products are either destroyed or reexported and will incur extra fees.\nPublic and private companies are now caught in the crosshairs – left struggling with limited information to navigate new laws, and stand to lose millions, according to one attorney.\n\"I've spoken to executives, CFOs, CEOs, and also their investors in their boards because they're concerned about this,\" said Angela Santos, a New York attorney for the\n. \"These forced labor laws could cost companies millions of dollars between preparing and conducting the due diligence hiring new staff to handle this.\"\nSantos says she deals with forced labor issues every day.

But that's changing – there's now a push for companies to know their entire supply chain.\n\"It is a huge burdensome task for companies and can be really problematic for small- and medium-sized companies that don't have those kinds of resources,\" Santos said.\nSo is pulling out of China the answer?\n\"Many companies are still reliant on China for their supply chain...

They've been updated several times over the years, banning nearly every type of exchange of goods and services except those meant for humanitarian aid and informational services. Even those exempted categories still require a specialized license from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security.\nWhile many of the harshest sanctions imposed on Russia didn't start until after the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, many exports to the country had been restricted since at least 2014 when Russia first violated Ukrainian sovereignty by annexing the country's eastern peninsula, Crimea.\nIn the near-decade since, American semiconductor components have still found their way into Russian weapons.\n\"For the Russian systems, we see that a lot of these components were manufactured between 2014 and 2021. And for Iranian systems, we found a lot of components made in 2021, 2020 and then we've got some components from 2022, as well,\" said CAR's Spleeters.\nThe more recently dated parts demonstrate how Iran and Russia may have circumvented U.S. restrictions, according to the analyses done by CAR and RUSI.\nEven more troublesome, according to that research: Some of the discovered components are classified as dual-use goods, with what are called Export Control Classification Numbers on the Commerce Control List. This means that a chip could be sold legally to a country for consumer or commercial use, only to then be resold to a company in a different country on the secondary market for military use. This type of re-routing of goods is known as transshipment and causes three problems, according to industry experts.\nFirst, it's more difficult for manufacturers and governments to trace end users, and second, it raises questions about the effectiveness of existing export controls given that many of these products were made recently and would have fallen under stricter regulations. What's more, it underscores that an outright ban is likely unachievable, given the dual use of certain chips that are needed for commercial products.\nAll seven of the U.S. chipmakers CNBC contacted for comment condemned the unauthorized diversion of their products to countries like Russia and Iran.\nA spokesperson for AMD said the company would take \"immediate measures per our contract terms\" if any of its products were found to be sold to these countries or regions.\nOnsemi called export-control violations a \"material breach\" and said they \"may lead to the termination of our contractual relationship with business partners.\"\nTexas Instruments said it does not \"support or condone\" the use of its products \"in applications for which they weren't designed.\"\nA spokesperson for Intel said, \"We do not always know nor can we control what products our customers create or the applications end-users may develop,\" but stressed the chipmaker \"does not support or tolerate our products being used to violate human rights.\"\nAnalog Devices said it takes the unintended misuse of its products \"very seriously\" and is strengthening efforts to counter these issues by \"implementing enhanced monitoring and audit processes and taking enforcement action where appropriate.\"\nMicrochip Technology said it uses \"various methods including screening customers against restricted party lists\" to help prevent the illegal use of its products.\nAnd Infineon said it has directed global distribution partners to \"prevent deliveries and to implement measures that will prevent any diversion of Infineon products or services contrary to the sanctions,\" adding that it has reiterated this position \"several times.\"\nAlthough the semiconductor companies and government officials CNBC spoke to acknowledge the unauthorized use of American chips is a serious issue, experts can't agree on who is to blame.\n\"I don't think the bulk of the bad behavior is with the manufacturer ... It's the ultimate buyers where I think you've got the real problem,\" said Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\"I think our supply chains are really so fundamentally weak,\" said Nazak Nikakhtar, a partner at the law firm Wiley Rein and the former assistant secretary for industry and analysis at the International Trade Administration. \"What I see all too often is for companies just to say, 'This is not my problem. I have a good compliance mechanism. This is somebody else's fault.'\"\nOthers, however, blame what they say is a lack of government oversight.\n\"The Department of Commerce has been lax about export controls for too long, sending critical supplies like chips to third parties which it knows will turn around and sell those materials to adversary militaries. This must end,\" said Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark, who serves on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. \"We should deny export licenses to companies if we even suspect that they are helping our enemies evade U.S. sanctions.\"\nA spokesperson for the Commerce Department said its officials are aware of the transshipment issue with microelectronics and other goods. In response to the war in Ukraine, the department formed what it's calling a \"Global Export Control Coalition,\" consisting of 38 international partners, many of which were key trading partners of Russia prior to the invasion of Ukraine.\nThe group's purpose is to siphon off Russia's access to many goods by implementing the same level of trade restrictions across the entire group.\n\"We're constantly in communication with our allies and our interagency partners. We're constantly tracking as much as we can, using every source of information that we have access to, to try and stay one step ahead and close off as many illicit networks as we can,\" the department spokesperson said.\nStronger cooperation from U.S. allies could help lessen the degree to which these components end up in the hands of bad actors, according to Nikakhtar.\n\"Ally engagement in doing press releases and stating intent to do something is one thing, but really, the rubber has to meet the road. Allies need to revamp their system to ensure that the technologies aren't being exported,\" she said. \"And the United States needs to lead.\""},

Discovery hedges its bets in streaming", "date": "2023-04-15T11:00:01+0000", "content": "Humble as he may be,\nCEO David Zaslav proved this week he's definitely a name dropper.\nWarner Bros. Discovery\n, featuring a combination of programming from HBO Max and Discovery+. It will launch May 23 in the U.S., later this year in Latin America, and in the rest of the world in 2024. And it'll be named \"Max\" — sans \"HBO.\"\nAt surface level, Warner Bros. Discovery's decision to do away with the name HBO Max is a logical marketing choice. Look deeper, and it starts to resemble a microcosm of an existential tension that lies at the heart of the company — and the media industry more broadly.\nThe company is trying to compete with\nand\nto be a winner in streaming, while at the same time pushing a message of financial discipline that deprioritizes streaming subscriber additions. It's a question of quality versus quantity, and Warner Bros. Discovery is trying to play both sides.\n\"Max is where consumers can finally say, 'Here's a service that not only has something for everybody in my household, but something great for everybody in my household,\" said JB Perrette, the company's head of streaming,\non Wednesday in Burbank, California.\nPerrette explained Wednesday why Warner Bros. Discovery removed the HBO part of the name from the new service. HBO is synonymous with adult entertainment, and Max will lean into offering programming for kids and families, he said.\n\"We all love HBO,\" said Perrette. \"It's a brand that's been built over five decades to be the edgy, ground-breaking trend-setter for entertainment for adults. But it's not exactly where parents would most easily drop off their kids. Not surprisingly, the category hasn't met its true potential on HBO Max.\"\nWarner Bros. Discovery executives felt the name HBO\nfor the streaming service because it scared away potential audiences. They also\nby the flood of Discovery's reality TV programming set to join the platform, such as \"Dr. Pimple Popper,\" \"90 Day Fiance\" and various HGTV shows that more readily serve as background TV than fare for office water-cooler conversation.\n\"HBO is not TV. HBO is HBO. It needs to stay that way,\" Perrette said at the event. \"We will not push it to the breaking point by forcing it to take on the full breadth of this new content proposition had we kept the name in the service brand. By doing so, we'll better elevate and showcase our unparalleled array of other content and brands that will be key to broadening the appeal to this enhanced product.\"\nThe company's reasoning is rational. HBO appeals to a certain audience, but also doesn't appeal to a certain audience. HBO fans won't unsubscribe from the service in response to the name Max, but some people who were scared off by HBO may now sign up once the adult brand has been obscured by the deluge of distinctly un-HBO content coming to the service.\nWhen HBO Max initially launched, AT&T and WarnerMedia executives emphasized to subscribers that this new app was, first and foremost, the home of HBO. Now, about 80 million subscribers later, that point is less important. Those who want HBO already know where to find it, and HBO Max will simply morph into Max on most platforms.\nStreaming is entering its \"teenage\" years, Perrette said, and Max as a name makes more sense to keep adding subscribers globally in a lower-growth world.\nThis would be the end of the story if Warner Bros. Discovery's stated goal was to maximize (no pun intended) the number of subscribers who sign up for Max.\nThat was every media company's goal when Zaslav agreed to merge Discovery with WarnerMedia\n. But according to Zaslav, that's no longer the priority.\n\"I'd rather have 100 million subscribers or 150 million subscribers and have it be really profitable than try and stretch for some big number, and in the end, lose money,\" Zaslav\n's Julia Boorstin after the presentation Wednesday. \"We take a look at what people watch on Max and we can see exactly what they like and exactly what they don't. And some of the stuff they're not watching, we can put it on a free AVOD [advertising-supported video on demand] platform, and some of the stuff that they're not watching, we can keep it nonexclusively on Max, but we could also sell it to others.\"\n\"We are relentlessly focused on creating great content and monetizing in every way possible,\" he said.\nWith its new streaming strategy — and Max at the center — Warner Bros. Discovery is hedging its bets.\nThe company is keeping Discovery+ around for customers who are happy to pay $5 or $7 for just Discovery's programming. Perrette said the company doesn't \"want to leave any of its profitable subscribers behind.\"\nZaslav also alluded to Warner Bros. Discovery's free ad-supported service, which\nis coming later this year.\nWarner Bros. Discovery could have kept HBO Max around, too. For those customers who wanted both Discovery+ and HBO Max, it could have offered a bundle for a discounted price. That's been Disney's strategy, which offers\nHulu, ESPN+ and Disney+.\nInstead, the company loaded up one service with everything it has, which may also eventually include some news from CNN and sports such as NBA or NHL games. Zaslav said Wednesday he'd have more details on that \"in the coming months.\" Don't forget, Zaslav\njust about a month into its existence.\nWarner Bros. Discovery is building Max as a one-size-fits-all option so that it has the scale to stick around in a post-cable world that's coming increasingly quickly.\nBut Zaslav is also telling investors he's fine with limiting Max's growth. It's more important for him to make money than to compete with Disney and Netflix to become the world's largest streamer.\nIt's a delicate balance:\n,\n's NBCUniversal and even\nare\n. Investors turned on the narrative of pursuing streaming growth at all costs last year, cutting the valuations of many media and entertainment companies in half.\nWhat's happening now is, at its core, a hedge. The media industry knows streaming is the future but growth has slowed. Zaslav has championed the value of the traditional pay-TV bundle while criticizing the previous WarnerMedia regime's profligate spending on streaming. He's trying to give investors a new reason to get excited about Warner Bros. Discovery. That message, Zaslav hopes, is\n.\n\"Ultimately, I'm a free cash flow guy,\" Zaslav said Wednesday. \"We want great talent, but ultimately, if we're not making money on subs, if we don't have any ARPU [average revenue per user], we're not helping ourselves and we're not helping shareholders.\"\nThere are some indications he could be on to something. Warner Bros. Discovery shares are up nearly 50% this year after falling about 60% last year.\nBut when you take a two-part name — HBO and Max — and keep just the Max, the implication is \"big\" over \"quality.\"\nThat was AT&T's message. It hasn't been Zaslav's message until now."},

J&J executives on an earnings call cited currency dynamics, noting that foreign exchange headwinds had a negative impact of roughly $3 billion in the pharmaceutical business in 2022.\nThe stock closed nearly 3% lower Tuesday. Shares are down more than 9% for the year through the close, putting the company's market value at roughly $420 billion.\nJ&J is now forecasting 2023 sales of $97.9 billion to $98.9 billion, about $1 billion higher than the guidance provided in January. The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings outlook to $10.60 to $10.70 per share, from a previous forecast of $10.45 to $10.65.\nCFO Joseph Wolk told CNBC on Tuesday that J&J raised its guidance due to strong growth across all three business sectors — consumer health, pharmaceuticals and medical devices.\n\"If you think about how we started the year and guidance in January, we were responsibly cautious,\" he said on \"Squawk Box.\" \"First-quarter growth was much stronger than even fourth-quarter growth for all three business units, and our positions kind of change to responsibly optimistic at this point. We feel very good about 2023.\"\nHe added that data being produced on J&J's drug for the cancer\nmultiple myeloma and procedural data in its medical devices unit make the company \"feel very, very good about what lies beyond 2023.\"\nJ&J reported $13.4 billion in pharmaceutical sales, which grew more than 4% over the same quarter last year. The company said that increase was driven by sales of Darzalex, a biologic for the treatment of multiple myeloma, and the blockbuster drug Stelara, which is used to treat a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.\nJ&J will lose patent protection on Stelara later this year. During a conference call, Wolk said the company is \"committed to growing through the loss.\"\nSales for the company's medical devices business rose to nearly $7.5 billion, up 7.3% from the first quarter of 2022. J&J said its\n, a cardiovascular medical technology company, in December last year fueled that rise.\nJ&J's consumer health business, which it is spinning off into a separate publicly traded company this year, reported about $3.8 billion in sales.\nThat unit grew 7.4% over the same period last year, primarily driven by over-the-counter products such as Tylenol and skin health products under brands such as Neutrogena and Aveeno.\nWolk told CNBC the company is making \"great progress\" on the separation of its consumer health business. But J&J hasn't been clear about when exactly the split will happen.\nJ&J also announced its board has approved a 5.3% quarterly dividend increase, to $1.19 per share, due to the company's strong 2022 performance.\nThe New Brunswick, New Jersey-based company entered this earnings season with its shares on the rise after it offered more clarity on the long-running legal fight over its talc-based baby powder products. Earlier this month, J&J\nto pay nearly $9 billion over the next 25 years to settle thousands of allegations that its baby powder and other talc products caused cancer.\nJ&J's subsidiary LTL Management also refiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this month after its first attempt was thwarted.\nWolk during a conference call said the company will bring the proposed reorganization plan to bankruptcy court in mid-May. He expressed confidence that claimants will vote to approve the plan, noting that 60,000 claimants have already committed to do so.\nThe company expects to win over a small but \"vocal minority\" of plaintiff attorneys who oppose the plan, added Andrew White, J&J's assistant general counsel.\nWolk continued to deny the talc allegations, calling it \"unfortunate\" that J&J has to \"put dollars towards quite frankly baseless scientific claims.\"\nLawsuits allege the company's talc products were contaminated with the carcinogen asbestos, which caused ovarian cancer in thousands of individuals. Some suits link several deaths to J&J's talc products."},

But with under 15 minutes left in the countdown, the company announced a \"scrub,\" postponing the launch for at least 48 hours.\nThe Starship orbital launch is the culmination of several years of regulatory work and technological tests. Company leadership has repeatedly stressed the experimental nature of the launch. SpaceX had hoped to conduct the first orbital Starship launch as early as summer 2021, but delays in development and\npushed back the timeline.\nStarship is designed to carry cargo and people beyond Earth and is critical to NASA's plan to return astronauts to the moon. Two years ago, SpaceX won a nearly $3 billion contract from NASA to use Starship as a crewed lunar lander. That would see Starship be used for as part of NASA's Artemis moon program, delivering astronauts to the lunar surface from the agency's SLS rocket and Orion capsule.\nBelow are live updates out of South Texas.\nSpaceX's Kate Tice said the company expects it to be a minimum of 48 hours to make another attempt, which would be Wednesday.\n\"We're not quite sure what that timing will be\" for the next attempt, Tice said, noting that it will depend on the data SpaceX saw from today's attempt.\nSpaceX is postponing the launch attempt.\nInsprucker said the flight director decided \"to stop the launch for today\" due to an issue with the pressurization system in the Super Heavy booster.\nThe company is scrubbing the launch attempt, but will continue the countdown until about the 10-second mark to get more data about loading the rocket with propellant, in what is known as a \"wet dress rehearsal.\"\n, Musk said that a pressure valve \"appears to be frozen.\"\nSpaceX principal integration engineer Insprucker said Starship first stage team is \"working a pressurization issue,\" which if unresolved would prevent launch and cause today to be a wet dress rehearsal.\nInsprucker also said the company is checking in with the U.S. Coast Guard about a boat that is \"in the safety perimeter,\" but are working to get that out of the way in time for launch.\nBelow is an overview of the flight, assuming it goes according to plan. Starship would reach space and travel most of the way around the Earth before splashing down off the coast of Kauai.\nJohn Insprucker, SpaceX principal integration engineer and webcast cult legend, said during the company's livestream that wind is a watch item for liftoff but that it is currently \"within limits\" for launch.\nThat phrase has become the official motto of this Starship test flight, with Elon Musk and others from SpaceX emphasizing the experimental nature of the launch.\n\"It's the first launch of a very complicated gigantic rocket,\" Musk said during a Twitter Spaces discussion on Sunday.\nThe most recent Starship flight test stayed within Earth's atmosphere, flying no more than 40,000 feet altitude. While that launch landed successfully, previous short flight tests have had dramatic and explosive results – one of the potential outcomes that Musk has warned about for today's launch.\nJust 15 minutes after starting its live stream, SpaceX's YouTube webcast has drawn more than 585,000 viewers. There's 30 minutes to go before launch.\nFully-stacked on the Super Heavy booster, Starship stands 394 feet tall, and is about 30 feet in diameter – making it the tallest rocket ever assembled.\nThe Super Heavy booster is what begins the rocket's journey to space. At its base are 33 Raptor engines, which together produce 16.7 million pounds of thrust – double the 8.8 million pounds of thrust of NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which\nlate last year.\nStarship itself has six Raptor engines, with three for use while in the Earth's atmosphere and three for operating in the vacuum of space.\nSpaceX has started its live stream of the launch. You can watch it above or on YouTube.\nSo far the stream features a slate of slow-moving star graphics and the company's logo, with futuristic music in the background.\nHere at the SpaceX press site, a bit of Elon Musk's corporate synergies are on display: The internet service is powered by the company's Starlink satellites — and the login for the Wi-Fi is a Twitter reference.\nIt's an hour to launch, based on current targets.\nSpaceX has a 150-minute window to get Starship off the ground today, which began at 8 a.m. ET and goes until 10:30 a.m. ET.\nSouth Padre Island and Brownsville, a pair of small cities on the furthest southern border of Texas, are teeming with SpaceX enthusiasts and VIPs who have come to witness the launch in person. As always with a new rocket, a debut launch can easily feature multiple false starts and delays of days or weeks.\nOne of the space agency's WB-57 aircraft has begun circling above the launch site. NASA uses the WB-57 in a variety of ways, but it often captures video and imagery of rocket launches and spacecraft re-entering.\nI'm sitting in some temporary bleachers with other members of the press near the amphitheater on the southern tip of South Padre Island, with a clear view of Starship on the launch pad about five miles away.\nFor reference, the press site at NASA's Kennedy Space Center is a little over three miles away from the launchpads in Florida.\nIn a discussion on Twitter Spaces on Sunday evening, Elon Musk repeatedly called for low expectations for this Starship launch, saying it would be a success simply to not \"blow up the launch pad\" and reach orbit.\nMusk also noted that for Monday's attempt, the launch is \"more likely to scrub,\" meaning postpone, \"than fly.\"\nWith roughly 90 minutes to go until launch, SpaceX is about to begin loading the Super Heavy booster with liquid oxygen and liquid methane, the propellants the company uses to fuel the rocket's engines. In total, the rocket is filled with more than 10 million pounds of propellant.\nThe company is targeting an 8:20 a.m. CT / 9:20 a.m. ET launch.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration on Friday issued SpaceX with the\nthe company needed to perform the flight, which represents the first time it tries to fly Starship to space. Company leadership has previously stressed the experimental nature of the launch, with SpaceX working for the past several years to build up to this attempt.\nSpaceX has not disclosed how much it has spent on the Starship program to date, but Musk previously estimated that he expects it will cost the company about $5 billion to complete."},

The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, could decide at any time how to proceed with the case.\nThe group, the Alliance Defending Freedom, asked the Supreme Court, should the justices decide to take the case, to look into whether an 1873 law called the Comstock Act bans mail delivery of mifepristone. The anti-abortion organization also said the court should consider whether the FDA properly approved mifepristone in 2000 if it takes the case.\nMifepristone, used in combination with a drug called misoprostol, is the most common method to terminate a pregnancy in the U.S., accounting for about half of all abortions. If the lower court rulings against mifepristone ultimately stand, access to abortion could face restrictions even in some states where the procedure remains legal.\nAttorneys with the Alliance Defending Freedom accused the FDA of illegally rolling back restrictions on mifepristone over the years. The organization represents a coalition of doctors who oppose abortion called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine.\nFormer FDA officials, the pharmaceutical industry, 23 U.S. states, hundreds of members of Congress and leading medical associations all strongly dispute those claims. They say the FDA determined mifepristone was safe and effective based on a rigorous scientific review, and its decision regulating the medication falls well within its authority granted by Congress.\nThe former FDA officials and a coalition of drug companies that include\n, in a separate briefs to the Supreme Court, warned that the lower court rulings restricting mifepristone would deliver a severe blow to the FDA's regulatory powers and chill research, development and investment in new medications.\nFederal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk of the U.S. Northern District of Texas earlier this month suspended the FDA's approval of mifepristone and every subsequent action the agency had taken to ease access to the medication.\nRead CNBC's latest global health coverage:\nThe U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked part of Kacsmaryk's order and kept the FDA approval in place, but reimposed restrictions on how mifepristone is used and distributed.\nThe appeals blocked mail delivery of mifepristone, required patients to visit a doctor to obtain the medication, and shortened the time frame when women can take the drug to the seventh week of pregnancy. They also blocked the 2019 approval of the generic version of mifepristone distributed by another company called GenBioPro.\nAlito hit pause on those lower court decisions and has allowed mifepristone to remain more broadly available for now.\n\"Women will still have access to chemical abortion drugs under the same restrictions that existed for the first 16 years of mifepristone's use,\" argued the Alliance Defending Freedom's attorneys, led by Erik Baptist. \"The only effect of the lower court's order is to restore a modicum of safety for the women and girls who use the drug, including supervision and oversight by a physician.\"\nBut the Justice Department and Danco, in their emergency requests to the Supreme Court, said the lower court rulings would effectively take mifepristone off the market for months as the FDA adjusts the medication's labeling to comply with the 5th Circuit's decision.\nU.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said the litigation and lower court rulings have been \"troubling at every level\" and would have sweeping consequences for the pharmaceutical industry, women's health and the FDA's drug approval powers.\nThe government also argued that complying with the appeals court ruling would effectively be in violation of a competing court order by Judge Thomas Rice of the U.S. Eastern District of Washington.

High Commissioner for Human Rights\nthe death toll in Ukraine is likely higher because the armed conflict can delay fatality reports.\n\"These figures are just the tip of the iceberg. Most of the casualties resulted from the Russian forces' use of wide-impact explosive weaponry in residential neighborhoods,\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said last week during a speech before the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva.\nAfter Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit was made public on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces had shelled a market in the center of the city of Kherson, killing one and injuring at least seven, according to a report on\n.\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Kremlin reported that Putin had visited troops at a military base in the wider Kherson region.\nUkraine is rejecting reports that Russian inspectors have restarted inspections of export ships under the Black Sea grain deal.\n\"Nothing has been resolved. There are no inspections,\" Reuters quoted an unnamed Ukrainian official as saying.\nEarlier on Tuesday, Russian state news agency RIA cited a Russian foreign ministry official saying that Russian inspections of grain ships leaving Ukraine had restarted.\nA deal allowing the safe Black Sea export of Ukrainian grain was renewed in mid-March for at least 60 days — just half of the intended period — after Russia warned that any further extension beyond mid-May would depend on the removal of some Western sanctions.\nUkraine, an agricultural powerhouse, was one of the world's top exporters of grain and other produce like corn and sunflower oil before Russia's invasion. A Russian naval blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports caused a spike in prices of those goods worldwide and stoked fears of food crises in parts of the developing world.\nRomania's ruling Social Democrat party (PSD) said it plans to request that the country's governing coalition enact a temporary ban on Ukrainian grain imports, which would make it the latest in a group of Eastern and Central European countries to put bans on the produce.\nPoland, Hungary and Slovakia recently put bans on Ukrainian grain in an effort to shield domestic producers from being undercut by the cheaper produce, as leaders from those countries — some of whom are Ukraine's most vocal supporters — face pressure and protest from their own grain farmers.\n\"PSD will ask the governing coalition to make a political decision to enable ... the government to issue the decree,\" Romania's PSD said in a statement.\n\"At the same time, Romania must continue to support Ukraine by facilitating the transit of farm products to other European Union states or to Black Sea commercial routes,\" it said.\nSwitzerland's government said it was working to seriously implement and enforce sanctions on Russia, after G7 ambassadors expressed concerns that Russians could take advantage of Swiss privacy laws and other loopholes to hide large sums of money in offshore assets.\n\"We adopted the (EU) sanctions and of course we take this completely seriously and we are simply doing everything that can be done in order to enforce them seriously,\" Swiss President Alain Berset said during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\nHe also stressed his country's condemnation of Russia for its war, and support for Ukraine.\nThe G7 letter sent to the Swiss Federal Council this week said the group of nations was concerned that \"law enforcement officials are blocked from investigating illicit financial structures … because of privacy protections,\" and that Swiss officials \"were unable to freeze assets under protections for dual nationals, legal residents, those with legal ties to Swiss entities, or those holding indirect beneficial ownership. We share a concern that these loopholes to legal action put Switzerland at reputational risk.\"\nSwitzerland's State Secretariat for Economic Affairs said the concerns were baseless.\nA Moscow court rejected Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich's appeal against pre-trial detention, meaning he will remain held in a former KGB prison until at least May 29, Reuters reported.\nLynne Tracy, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, visited Gershkovich in prison Monday and reported that he was in good health.\nRussian investigators formally charged the American journalist with espionage on April 7. Gershkovich denies the charges and says he was working as a journalist, not for the U.S. government.\nRussia's Federal Security Service, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said in late March that it had\nand had opened an espionage case against the 31-year-old.\nGershkovich's detention marked the first time an American journalist has been detained in Russia on espionage charges since the end of the Cold War.\nUkraine will try to unblock exports of food and grain through Poland in a second day of talks in Warsaw on Tuesday after some of its staunchest allies in central Europe imposed bans on its products.\nPoland, Hungary and Slovakia have recently banned imports of Ukrainian grains and produce to protect their markets from an influx of cheaper supply.\nUkraine's exports via these countries have risen due to Russia's invasion, which has blocked some of its Black Sea ports.\nBottlenecks caused by slowed rail shipments or a lack of railcars have exacerbated the problem, trapping large quantities of Ukrainian grain in Central Europe which has lowered prices and hurt sales by local farmers, turning up the heat on governments.\nPoland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party faces an election this year and counts on rural areas for support.\nUkraine and Poland began talks on Monday over Warsaw's ban, which went further than others by stopping Ukrainian grain and food in transit.\nPolish Agriculture Minister Robert Telus told public radio station PR1 on Tuesday that talks were set to continue.\nIn Hungary, officials were checking shipments of Ukrainian grain at the border, only allowing transit deliveries to pass, MTI news agency cited Marton Nobilis, the Agriculture Ministry's state secretary for the food industry and trade policy, as saying.\nHungary and other countries in central Europe have joined together in pushing for an EU-wide solution.\nThe EU has criticised Poland, Hungary and Slovakia for putting individual bans in place. EU envoys were set to discuss the bans on Wednesday, according to a senior EU official, who said low global prices and demand meant grain was staying in the bloc rather than being sold on.\nThe bans come as a deal allowing Ukraine to export millions of tonnes of Ukrainian grain via the Black Sea is set to expire on May 18.\nRussian demands have left the prospect of an extension of the deal uncertain. The combined impact of the bans and failure to agree an extension would strand millions of tonnes of grain inside Ukraine, a major agricultural producer that generate a substantial part of its gross domestic product from grain and food sales.\nRussia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Moscow and Beijing should expand their military cooperation as he held talks with his Chinese counterpart, Li Shangfu, in Moscow on Tuesday.\nShoigu congratulated Li on his recent appointment as Chinese's defense minister and said:\n\"I am convinced that your extensive experience of interaction with the Russian Federation will contribute both to the development of the armed forces of the PRC [People's Republic of China] and to the expansion of military cooperation between our countries,\" Shoigu said, according to news agency RIA Novosti.\n\"I look forward to the closest and most fruitful cooperation with you in the spirit of unbreakable friendship between our countries, peoples, and also the armed forces of Russia and China,\" Shoigu said.\nShoigu said Russia appreciated Li choosing Russia as the location of his first foreign trip in the role. Russia and China have been cultivating deeper political and military ties in recent years and Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Moscow last month.\nHeavy fighting has continued along the front line in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, Britain's Defense Ministry said Tuesday, but it noted that Russia could be concentrating its forces on capturing Bakhmut now.\n\"There is a realistic possibility that Russia has reduced troop numbers and is decreasing offensive action around Donetsk city, most likely to divert resources towards the Bakhmut sector,\" the ministry said in an intelligence update on Twitter.\nThe U.K. said Russian regular units and mercenary forces belonging to the Wagner Group \"continue to make creeping advances\" in Bakhmut and that \"the front line in the town centre largely follows the main railway line.\"\n\"Ukraine is generally holding Russia's envelopment from the south along the line of Korsunskovo Street, the old main road west out of town,\" the ministry said.\nFor both sides, the exact sequencing of any major drawdown of their units around Bakhmut has become a critical question, the ministry noted, with \"Ukraine wanting to free-up an offensive force while Russia likely aspires to regenerate an operational reserve.\"\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has made a rare trip to meet Russian military commanders and troops fighting in Ukraine, the Kremlin said Tuesday.\nPutin reportedly visited the headquarters of troops located in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine, a region partially occupied by Russian forces, where he was briefed on the military situation there by air force and army commanders.\nOn arriving at the headquarters, Putin reportedly said, \"I don't want to distract you from your direct duties related to command and control, so we are working here in a business-like manner, briefly, but concretely,\"\n.\n\"It is important for me to hear your opinion on how the situation is developing, to listen to you, to exchange information,\" Putin said.\nThe president was then seen asking military commanders to report on the situation in Kherson and nearby Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine, which is also partially occupied.\nIt's rare for Putin to visit Russian troops in Ukraine, and this was the first visit by the president to the Kherson region. The last time Putin was seen in Ukraine was on March 19, when he purportedly visited Mariupol and Rostov-on-Don, where he also met military leaders.\nThe White House called for regular and routine visits with detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich.\n\"Certainly we conveyed to him how hard we are going to continue to work his case,\" National security council spokesman John Kirby said on a conference call with reporters.\n\"We also conveyed that same message to his family,\" Kirby added.\nEarlier on Monday, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy said she visited Gershkovich at Lefortovo prison.\nGershkovich was arrested on March 29 on espionage allegations and, if convicted, the 31-year-old journalist could face a 20-year prison sentence under Russian law.\nThe Biden administration and The Wall Street Journal have denied allegations that Gershkovich has ever worked on behalf of the U.S. government as a spy.\nUkrainian artillerymen prepare to launch artillery toward Russian positions on the frontline, in Donetsk region.\nThere's been an international outcry after a Russian court sentenced Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza to 25 years in prison for treason, and other charges including spreading \"false\" information about the Russian army.\nThe U.S., U.K. and Germany condemned the sentence with London calling the conviction of Kara-Murza, an opposition politician, journalist, and human rights activist in Russia and a British dual national, \"politically motivated.\"\nThe U.K's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office has summoned the Russian ambassador Andrey Kelin, and said it would \"make clear that the U.K. considers Mr Kara-Murza's conviction to be contrary to Russia's international obligations on human rights, including the right to a fair trial.\"\nBritain's Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said \"Russia's lack of commitment to protecting fundamental human rights, including freedom of expression, is alarming. We continue to urge Russia to adhere to its international obligations including Vladimir Kara-Murza's entitlement to proper healthcare.\"\nThe U.S. embassy in Russia said in a statement that \"the court's decision today to sentence Vladimir Kara-Murza to 25 years in prison for expressing an opinion critical of the policies of his government is another terrible sign of the repression that has taken hold in Russia. We call for his immediate release.\"\nElsewhere, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in\nthat the 25-year prison sentence was \"another blow to the rule of law and civic space in the Russian Federation.\"\n\"No one should be deprived of their liberty for exercising their human rights, and I call on the Russian authorities to release him without delay,\" Turk said.\nA Moscow court on Monday jailed outspoken Kremlin critic Vladimir Kara-Murza for a quarter of a century  after it found him guilty of treason and other offenses he denied,\n.\nKara-Murza, 41, a father of three and an opposition politician who holds Russian and British passports, spent years speaking out against President Vladimir Putin and sought to have Western governments impose sanctions on Russia and individual Russians for purported human rights violations, Reuters reported.\nState prosecutors had accused him of treason and of discrediting the Russian military after he criticized what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.\nIn his final speech to the court last week, Kara-Murza had compared his own trial, which was held behind closed doors, to Josef Stalin's show trials in the 1930s and had declined to ask the court to acquit him, saying he stood by and was proud of everything he had said, according to Reuters.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin met with China's Defense Minister Li Shangfu on Sunday, marking the latest high-profile meeting between Russian and Chinese officials in recent months.\nFootage of the meeting showed Putin shaking hands with Li and then sitting down at a table at which Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was also seen.\n\"We are working actively through our military departments, regularly exchange useful information, work together in the field of military-technical cooperation, and hold joint exercises,\" Putin said, Reuters reported.\nRecent joint drills, he said, strengthened \"the extremely trusting, strategic nature of our relations.\"\nRussia's defense ministry said Friday that Li would make his first foreign trip to Russia on April 16-18 since his appointment to the post. The ministry said negotiations between Li and Shoigu would take place during the visit, which concludes Tuesday, and that the officials would discuss cooperation in the defense sphere and issues of global and regional security.\nPutin's latest meeting with a senior Chinese official comes almost a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow in March in which the leaders reaffirmed their strategic cooperation. Putin also met one of China's top diplomats, Wang Yi, in February.\nChina's State Council released a statement Sunday saying Beijing is willing to work with Russia to deepen \"strategic communication between the two militaries, strengthen multilateral coordination and cooperation, and make new contributions to the maintenance of world and regional security and stability.\""},

At least 185 people have been killed across the sprawling country.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking in Japan, said on Tuesday he had telephoned both army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and paramilitary leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo of the Rapid Support Forces, appealing for their rival forces to cease fire \"to allow the Sudanese to be safely reunited with families\" and to provide them with relief.\nThe ceasefire deal will not extend beyond the agreed 24 hours, Army General Shams El Din Kabbashi, a member of Sudan's ruling military council, said earlier on al Arabiya TV.\nA Reuters reporter in Khartoum said he heard tanks firing shortly after the truce was due to take hold.\nIt was unclear in the chaotic din who was behind the various bouts of gunfire, though the RSF issued a Facebook statement shortly after the truce was to take effect blaming the army for violations.\nOne resident told Reuters they had heard an air strike being carried out in Omdurman, Khartoum's sister city on the opposite bank of the Nile river.\nFighting had appeared to tail off close to the deadline for the ceasefire, which coincided with the evening breaking of the daily fast during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.\nEarlier in the day, the sounds of warplanes and explosions echoed across Khartoum. Residents in the neighbouring cities of Omdurman and Bahri reported air strikes that shook buildings and anti-aircraft fire. Fighting also raged in the west of the country, the United Nations said.\nIn video verified by Reuters, RSF fighters could be seen inside a section of the army headquarters in Khartoum. The fighters did not appear to control the sprawling site, a Reuters reporter in the capital said.\nBurhan heads a ruling council installed after the 2021 military coup and the 2019 ouster of Bashir, while Dagalo — better known as Hemedti — is his deputy on the ruling council.\nTheir power struggle has stalled the plan for a shift to civilian rule after decades of autocracy and military domination in Sudan, which sits at a strategic crossroads between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Africa's volatile Sahel region.\nUnless controlled, the violence also risks drawing in actors from Sudan's neighborhood who have backed different factions, and could play into competition for regional influence between Russia and the United States.\nFighters have attacked aid workers, hospitals and diplomats, including a European Union ambassador assaulted in his home.\nU.N. aid chief Martin Griffiths said humanitarian relief workers and facilities are continuing to be targeted in Sudan and the United Nations was \"receiving reports of attacks and sexual violence against aid workers.\"\n\"This is unacceptable and must stop,\" Griffiths posted on Twitter, adding that the U.N. aid office in South Darfur was also looted on Monday.\nThree workers for the World Food Programme were killed in the fighting on Saturday, and a U.N. plane was hit in crossfire at Khartoum's international airport.\nBlinken said a U.S. convoy was attacked despite its vehicles being marked with diplomatic license plates and bearing U.S. flags. Initial reports suggest the attack was undertaken by RSF-associated forces, he said, calling the action \"reckless.\" Blinken said all U.S. personnel were safe after the incident.\nAfter the call with Blinken, Hemedti said the RSF approved the ceasefire to ensure the safe passage of civilians and the evacuation of the wounded.\nIn a post on Twitter, he said he and Blinken \"discussed pressing issues\" and more talks were planned. The RSF issued a statement saying it was waging a battle to restore \"the rights of our people\" in what it called a new revolution.\nA previous, shorter ceasefire agreed for Sunday was widely ignored. Artillery volleys, strikes by combat aircraft and street fighting have made it almost impossible to travel in Khartoum, trapping residents and foreigners in their homes.\nThe main international airport has been under attack, halting commercial flights.\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was nearly impossible to provide humanitarian services around the capital. It warned that Sudan's health system was at risk of breakdown.\nThe outbreak of fighting followed rising tensions over a plan for the RSF's integration into the regular military.\nDiscord over the timetable for that process delayed the signing of the framework deal to launch a civilian transition that was due to be signed earlier this month.\nThe fighting has affected several parts of the country since Saturday, including the western desert region of Darfur, which borders Chad and suffered warfare from 2003 that killed as many as 300,000 people and displaced 2.7 million."},

The network also argued that Dominion's suit does not establish that the claims were aired with \"actual malice,\" a requirement to meet the legal standard for defamation.\nJury selection in the case wrapped up late Tuesday morning, but not without its fireworks. Just as the 12-member jury and 12 alternates were set and about to receive instructions, an alternate juror interrupted.\n\"Sir, I can't do this. I've been up all night. I can't do this,\" the alternate juror said, shaking his head.\nDavis also reminded the courtroom earlier on Tuesday that photos or live Tweets or blogs were not permitted from inside the main room. He noted that earlier on Tuesday someone was removed from the courtroom for taking photos. The person, a Fox News representative, was forced to delete the photos and permanently exit the courtroom.\nThe Fox representative misunderstood the courtroom rules and apologized, adding that the pictures were deleted immediately, the company told CNBC.\nThe judge said the person was removed and \"turned on everybody else,\" and said others in the courtroom were live-tweeting. Davis said he wouldn't tolerate this from anyone. \"If it's flagrant, you may be held in contempt,\" he said.\nThe trial was expected to last up to six weeks, and Judge Eric Davis appeared determined to stick to that timeframe.\n\"I'm going to keep it strict. I'm not going to give you an extra day,\" Davis told attorneys for both camps.\nDavis later told jurors not to be concerned with the delayed start to the trial, which began a\nthan previously planned: \"I will control the time. Don't concern yourself with that, it is my job,\" he said.\nOpening statements were slated to kick off Tuesday afternoon, meaning witnesses would likely have taken the stand starting Wednesday.\nCNBC's Eamon Javers reported Tony Fratto was slated to take the stand. Fratto, who is currently the head of communications for Goldman Sachs, was an external crisis communications expert for Dominion at the time of the 2020 election. Fratto was\nwith producers, on-air talent and reporters at Fox News.\nThe judge ruled earlier this month that the 92-year-old Murdoch and his son, Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch, could be\nin court. Other witnesses included Carlson, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott, Sean Hannity and other top TV personalities at Fox.\nIn the backdrop on Tuesday, Davis appointed a special master to investigate and determine whether Fox and its networks complied with discovery obligations, according to court papers. The investigation and communications to and from the special master will remain confidential.\nThe judge gave special master John Elzufon a May 15 deadline to send a written report on his investigation.\nThe move came after last week's pretrial hearing, when Davis sanctioned Fox and its parent company for withholding evidence from Dominion during the discovery process,\n.\nThe trial's unusual circumstances — most defamation cases settle out of court, and few promise in-person testimony from a parade of well-known media figures — along with a 10-figure claim for damages generated cacophonous media buzz. But it's far from clear\n, the case will have on Fox's reputation or its bottom line.\nDominion has also filed defamation lawsuits against Trump's former attorney\n, his ex-campaign lawyer Sidney Powell, right-wing news networks and other figures. Smartmatic, another elections technology firm, has\ndefamation lawsuits demanding billions of dollars in damages.\nBut the case against Fox has seized the spotlight in recent months — especially following the release of troves of\nand testimony from top Fox News talent and executives, including\nChairman Rupert Murdoch and opinion host Tucker Carlson.\nThe communications have cast a shade of scandal over the legal battle, revealing how some Fox personnel and other high-profile figures reacted behind the scenes to the events following the 2020 election. News outlets were quick to\nsome Fox personalities' private remarks about the election fraud claims with what was being said on air at the same time.\nDominion and Fox clashed Monday on how much money is actually at stake, with Fox stating Dominion had slashed its damages claim from an original amount of $1.6 billion and Dominion holding firm that \"the damages claim remains.\"\nOne piece of the lawsuit was previously decided: Davis last month\nthat the statements flagged by Dominion were, indeed, false. \"The evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that is CRYSTAL clear that none of the Statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true,\" Davis wrote.\nHis ruling clarified that the trial jury would determine who is responsible for publishing the false claims, and if those people acted with actual malice. That legal standard means proving that the claims were published with the knowledge they were false, or with reckless disregard for the truth.\nThe lead-up to the trial was marked by major twists, only heightening public interest.\nRecordings made by former Fox producer Abby Grossberg in 2020, which allegedly show Giuliani and Fox host Maria Bartiromo talking about voting software, were not handed over to Dominion, according to NBC. Grossberg\nlast month, alleging she was coerced into giving misleading testimony in the Dominion case.\nA Fox spokeswoman said after the hearing that it had \"produced the supplemental information from Ms. Grossberg when we first learned it.\"\n—"},

He has long pushed to ease the burden of care costs, but Congress has stifled those efforts during his first term.\n\"We're using the power of the federal government to get companies to do what's good for workers and, I might add, good for business as well,\" Biden said, speaking from the Rose Garden before signing. \"And folks, care workers deserve to make a decent living and that's a fight I'm willing to have.\"\nThe White House faces steep opposition to many of the social-spending proposals in the Republican-controlled House.

The White House, congressional Democrats and advocates said the plans would provide an economic boost and create jobs because it would allow employees who have dependents more flexibility to work.\nIn a call with reporters Monday previewing the executive action, a senior administration official said Biden is focused on doing everything he can to improve access on his own.\n\"This is a case where the president is working hard on the investment angle, has worked hard with Congress, that has not worked out quite as well,\" the official said.\nThe cost of care for older people and those with disabilities has spiked 40% in the last decade, according to White House data. During that time, the cost of child care has climbed 26%; it has spiked\nmore than 200% in the past 30 years.\nThe White House pointed to data from Boston Consulting Group that estimates economic output could drop $290 billion a year beginning in 2030 if the care pitfalls are not patched.\nEven before the pandemic in 2019, 76% of parents reported struggling to access affordable, dependable care, the White House said.\nBy going forward without congressional action, Biden is signaling the importance of the issue to him ahead of an expected reelection bid. The White House has long maintained that Biden's social-policy agenda is highly popular with the American public despite conservative gripes over costs.\nA second term in office could mean a renewed focus on pushing through many of the promises he was unable to pass under his ambitious Build Back Better agenda — even while Democrats held both chambers of Congress. While the Democratic-controlled Congress pushed pieces of his broad social-spending proposal, it cut an ambitious child-care program from it, among other policies.\n\"Too many families are struggling to afford or access high-quality care, and too many care workers are struggling to make a living doing this critically important work,\" Domestic Policy Council Director Susan Rice said on the call. \"The president's not going to wait to take action to address our nation's care crisis.\"\nIn his executive order, Biden asked Cabinet-level agencies to flag grant programs that can be used to fund care for children and long-term care for workers on federal projects. The plan also outlines ways to improve access to in-home care for veterans, promote care worker unionization, increase pay for early childhood educators and improve job quality for caregiving workers.\nThe White House is also mulling requiring companies seeking federal funds for job creation to provide expanded access to care benefits for their workers. The Commerce Department in March mandated that companies seeking substantial funds from the $52 billion semiconductor manufacturing and research program to identify how they will assist their workforce in accessing child care."},

Revenue grew to $8.16 billion from $7.87 billion in the prior-year period.\nShares of Netflix initially fell more than 10% but mostly recovered in after hours trading.\nNetflix's crackdown on password sharing has been top of mind for investors. Late last year, the company said\nrolling out measures to have people who have been borrowing other accounts create their own.\nThe company has said more than 100 million households share accounts, or about 43% of its global user base. That has affected its ability to invest in new content, Netflix has said. Both the ad-supported option and crackdown on password sharing\nboost profits.\n\"The launch in Q2 will be broad, including the U.S. and the bulk of our countries when we think about it from a revenue perspective,\" said co-CEO Greg Peters on Tuesday's earnings call. Peters likened the paid sharing transition to that of increasing prices – subscribers initially balk and cancel, then slowly return and sign up for their own accounts.\nIn February, Netflix\nin four countries: New Zealand, Canada, Portugal and Spain. The company said it would ask users in those countries to set a \"primary location\" for their accounts, and allow users to establish up to two \"sub accounts\" for those who don't live in their home base for extra fees.\nNetflix said Tuesday it has been pleased with its push to mitigate password sharing. In Latin America, the company said it saw cancellations after the news was announced, which affected near-term growth. But, Netflix added, those password borrowers would later activate their own accounts ad add existing members as \"extra member\" accounts. As a result, the company said, it is seeing more revenue.\nCanada, which will likely serve as a template for the U.S., has seen its membership base grow due to the launch of paid sharing, and revenue growth has accelerated and \"is growing faster than in the U.S.\"\nThe company said that as it rolls out its paid sharing initiatives, it expects near term engagement – which is measured by Nielsen for its ad-supported tier – to \"likely shrink modestly.\" Still, the company believes it will bounce back as its seen in international regions.\nNetflix said it believes paid sharing will ensure increased revenue in the future as it looks to improve its service. On Tuesday, Netflix said it expects to spend in the range of roughly $17 billion in 2024 on content.\nCo-CEO Ted Sarandos said Tuesday the company hopes to avoid\nand talks continue with the Writers Guild of America.\n\"We respect the writers and WGA and we couldn't be here without them. We don't want a strike,\" Sarandos said Tuesday. Still, Sarandos noted that if a strike were to occur, Netflix has a robust slate of TV and movies coming up.\nNetflix noted on Tuesday that \"competition remains intense as we compete with so many forms of entertainment.\"\nOn Tuesday, Netflix said goodbye to what got it started — its DVD mailing business, in which it would send out the discs in red envelopes to customers. The company's CEO Ted Sarandos said in a blog post that it would finally wind down the DVD business, which \"continues to shrink.\"\nA year ago, Netflix had reported\n, sending its shares on a downward spiral, as well as those of its media peers. The results\nand its streaming rivals\non profits over subscriber numbers.\nAs Netflix looked to boost its profits and subscriber base, it turned its focus to an ad-supported plan, as well as the password sharing crackdown.\nLast November, Netflix\nits cheaper tier with commercials, which costs $6.99 a month. The ad-supported tier came shortly after it lost subscribers as streaming competition ramped up.\nSarandos\nthe company is likely to offer multiple ad-supported tiers in the future.\nNetflix's ad-supported plan now has an average of 95% of the same content as what is on its commercial-free plans due to recent licensing deals, the company said Tuesday.\n\"We are pleased with the current performance and trajectory of our per-member advertising economics,\" Netflix said Tuesday.\nPeters added Tuesday Netflix wasn't prepared to announce or forecast expectations regarding its ad-supported plan.\nIn some markets, Netflix has seen users move between tiers after paid sharing was introduced, Peters said, although it was very \"country-specific.\"\nThe executives also addressed the glitch that left millions unable to watch the live airing of \"Love is Blind\" on Sunday.\nPeters and Sarandos both said the company was \"really sorry to have disappointed so many people.\"\nPeters added that from a technical perspective Netflix has the infrastructure to pull off a live airing, as it did with the Chris Rock comedy special in March. But that \"a bug was introduced\" when trying to improve the Chris Rock special. \"We hate it when these things happen but we will learn from it,\" Peters said."},

With an agency and industry-accepted rules in place, \"I think we'll have a better chance of advanced AI being beneficial to humanity,\" Musk said.\nThe centibillionaire, who is also co-founder of Neuralink and The Boring Co., said that he wants to start a new AI initiative called \"TruthGPT\" that he wants to be a \"maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe.\"\nPreviously, Musk signed a letter calling for a pause on\nwhich he and others believe can harm society.\n\"Contemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks, and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth?\" the letter read.\nThe new technology would ostensibly compete with similar efforts by Sam Altman-led OpenAI, which was initially funded by Musk, Google's DeepMind and other AI initiatives around the world.\n\"I think this might be the best path to safety, in the sense that an AI that cares about understanding the universe, it is unlikely to annihilate humans because we are an interesting part of the universe,\" Musk said on the show.\nMusk added that he is worried that current AI technology is \"being trained to be politically correct, which is simply another way of ... saying untruthful things.\"\nDuring the prime-time interview, Musk also discussed Twitter, the social media company\nlate last year in a $44 billion deal.\nCarlson asked Musk if he was surprised to learn how much access intelligence agencies had to Twitter.\nMusk said, \"The degree to which various regulatory agencies effectively have full access to what's going on on Twitter blew my mind.\" He said that included \"DMs\" or direct messages because they were not encrypted.\nIn the U.S., law enforcement agencies can subpoena a social media user's direct messages or any other information held by a U.S. company, which is not end-to-end encrypted.\nMusk is now promising that Twitter will allow users to \"toggle encryption on\" for direct messaging as early as next month.\nAsked if he believed Twitter would figure heavily in future elections as it did during President\n's campaign and presidency, Musk said, \"I think it will play a significant role in elections, not just domestically but internationally.\"\nTwitter is now running with about 20% of the employees it once had, which numbered around 7,500 at the time he took over, Musk said Monday without giving a specific number. \"If you're not trying to run some sort of glorified activist organization, you can really let go of a lot of people it turns out,\" Musk quipped.\nMusk has accused Twitter's prior management and technology of unfairly benefiting Democrats and left-leaning users.

And I'm definitely keen we make the most of that opportunity.\"\nJurisdictions around the world from Dubai to Singapore have been trying to position themselves as crypto-friendly places to encourage firms to set up shop there.\nThe U.S., meanwhile, has taken a hard line on cryptocurrency firms with its regulators stepping up enforcement action against companies.\nBritain, however, wants to position itself as a place for crypto firms to come. Last year, Rishi Sunak, then U.K. finance minister and now the prime minister, said his ambition was to make Britain a \"global hub for cryptoasset technology.\"\nCrypto companies\nand are pushing governments to come up with frameworks for them to operate. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission has used existing securities rules to target cryptocurrency firms.\nGriffith said that the U.K.'s regulatory approach would mix both existing regulations and new ones.\n\"Wherever possible, we want to see the same asset, the same transaction regulated in the same way. But there are some additional opportunities in the crypto asset or distributed ledger space and we want to take advantage of that,\" Griffith told CNBC.\nThe lawmaker pointed to the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which is currently working its way through Parliament, as an example of where upcoming legislation already includes some provisions on cryptocurrency. That specific law, which is not yet in force, aims to bring asset-backed stablecoins into the regulatory fold.\nStablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to mirror real-world assets such as the U.S. dollar.

The current rate, however, is around 6.4%.\nIn addition, 62% of buyers said they believed that a \"historically normal mortgage rate\" was below 5.5%. The average going back to 1971 is 7.75%, according to Freddie Mac.\n\"Our consulting team has witnessed this across the country, noting that home builders who choose to subsidize buyers' mortgage rates, bringing the overall rate down below 5.5%, have been achieving the most success. Many of the largest builders in the country have been buying mortgage rates down below 5.0%,\" said CEO John Burns and Maegan Sherlock, a senior research analyst, in the report.\nFor most buyers, the mortgage rate determines what they can afford, because generally they are focused less on the home price and more on the monthly payment; that monthly payment is all about the rate.\nIf so many potential buyers, however, are saying they won't buy unless they get a rate below 5.5%, they may be sitting on the sidelines for a while. Mortgage rates have been over 6% for nearly a year and are not expected to move much lower this year.\nAn April survey from U.S. News and World Report seems to corroborate these findings: It found that 66% of Americans who plan to buy a home this year said they are waiting until rates fall.\n\"Mortgage rates are about twice as high now as they were a little over a year ago, which has exacerbated housing affordability challenges ahead of the spring 2023 homebuying season,\" wrote Erika Giovanetti, loans expert at U.S. News, in a column discussing the survey's findings. \"Today's homebuyers are extremely sensitive to fluctuating interest rates, and a significant drop in mortgage rates would likely make the market more competitive.\"\nThe U.S. News survey also found that 25% of homebuyers who are holding out for lower rates are waiting until they drop below 5%. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they've had to reduce their housing budgets due to the current level of mortgage rates.\nWhile some buyers can't afford the home they might want at today's rates, others are choosing not to buy simply because they don't like the idea of a higher rate, even if they can afford it. Older consumers aren't necessarily more willing to accept higher rates just because they may have experienced them in the past, according to the John Burns report.\nPotential home sellers, likewise, find the current rates to be unacceptable, contributing to the severe lack of supply on the market. New listings in the four weeks ended April 9 were 25% lower than the same week the year before, according to Redfin, a real estate brokerage. That continues an eight-month streak of double-digit declines.\n\"Even if the Fed chooses not to hike interest rates next month, which would likely bring down mortgage rates, the limited supply of homes for sale would remain a major obstacle for would-be buyers,\" wrote Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, in the report. \"Rates dipping below 6% would probably pique the interest of more buyers, but enough homeowners have rates in the 3% or 4% range that we're unlikely to see a big uptick in new listings.\""},

The deal will kick off on May 1, ahead of WWE's Backlash event.\nFanatics became WWE's global e-commerce partner in 2022, a deal that later grew to include licensed merchandise, memorabilia, trading cards and collectibles.\n\"We've already experienced [Fanatics'] expertise in this category, and when we sat down and thought about how we could approach growing our retail business, we thought this could strengthen that growth,\" said Alex Varga, WWE senior vice president and head of corporate development.\nWWE has seen its live-event merchandise business grow as the company has returned to a fuller slate of events and shows as the pandemic has waned. In 2022, WWE reported that it had $23.8 million in venue merchandise revenue across 231 live events in 2022, up from $10.1 million the previous year when the company only had 101 live events. In comparison, WWE had $18.6 million in venue merchandise in 2019 across 260 events.\nAt its WrestleMania event earlier this month, the company said that it broke its all-time merchandise record, an increase of 20% compared to 2022, which was the previous high. It had more than 161,000 people in attendance over the two-night event.\nVarga said the expanded relationship with Fanatics will help WWE make a further \"connection between our e-commerce channel and our event retail channel,\" which could mean ordering something from the merchandise stand that could then be delivered to your home later.\nFanatics' existing relationships across sports could also further benefit WWE, Varga said. For example, WWE is hosting its SummerSlam event in August at Ford Field in Detroit, where the Detroit Lions play – Fanatics is the retail partner of the Lions, which will allow WWE to potentially use more of the retail spaces and team stores in the stadium.\nTeam relationships like the Lions and across other sports could be utilized too, Varga said, noting that WWE has found success recently with merchandise that is hyper-localized to the city the event is in – for example, a \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin shirt themed to Los Angeles. This expanded partnership could help WWE collaborate on those shirts with local teams as well.\nWWE has increased the number of items it also sells since partnering with Fanatics, and Varga said there is likely further room to grow. \"As they continue to grow their position in the space, we expect to grow with them,\" he said.\nFanatics, a three-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company, now has relationships with more than 900 sports properties across the globe, including nearly every major sports league in the U.S.\nThis shift in WWE's business comes after the news that it has\nwith UFC to form a new publicly traded company controlled by\n.\nEndeavor will own a 51% stake in the new combat sports and entertainment company, while WWE shareholders will have the remaining 49%, according to the terms of the agreement.

Apple's strategy over the years has involved getting users locked into its suite of products including the Apple Watch and services like Apple Music.\n\"Apple can cross sell other products such as Macs, Watch, AirPods, iPads and services to the growing iPhone user base maximising the revenue opportunity,\" Shah said.\nFor Apple, India also represents a key part of its manufacturing strategy for the future.\nApple\nlast year — the first time that the company has produced its latest device in the country, so close to its initial launch. Piyush Goyal, India's minister of commerce and industry, said in January that Apple is aiming to make 25% of all of its iPhones in India.\nPart of the move in India is tied to the government's push to bring high-tech manufacturing to the country.

As long as the company can buy automated tech for the same price, it's value is far greater than being used in a car, Li said. He pointed out how a machine doesn't need to eat or sleep.\nIt's not yet clear, however, how much investment and tech research is still needed to create robots that can perform the intricate welding and other final assembly tasks."},

The automaker recently announced it would be investing 1.8 billion Canadian dollars (about $1.3 billion) to transition the facility into a new electric vehicle hub.\nThis marks the first time Lincoln will import a vehicle to the U.S. from China.\nImporting a vehicle from China to the U.S. is not unprecedented but can draw public and political criticism or backlash, especially when tensions between the two countries are high.\nMost notably,\nhas been criticized for importing its Buick Envision crossover from China to the U.S. since 2016. The Detroit automaker has sold more than 200,000 of the China-made vehicles, which American union officials have called the \"Invasion\" and\nImporting a vehicle from overseas to the U.S. can make good business sense, however, for a company such as Ford.\n\"In this case, it's a good use of resources,\" said Stephanie Brinley, associate director of research at S&P Global Mobility. \"Without importing, Lincoln does not get the product, and the brand needs products between now and when its EVs arrive.\"\nBrinley said the decision to import the Nautilus does not suggest a fundamental shift for future Lincolns for the U.S. market, noting the company continues to produce most of its vehicles for the U.S. market in North America.\n\"Lincoln is a global brand that is growing,\" a Lincoln spokeswoman said in an email. \"As we execute our U.S. manufacturing growth plans, we think it makes sense to centralize Nautilus production in China for both markets (since we already produce Nautilus in China for the local market) which allows us to gain manufacturing efficiencies and retool our Oakville facility to get ready to build our next generation EVs.\"\nThe news comes a week after Ford released a report that said it was the top automaker in terms of vehicles assembled and hourly autoworkers employed in America as well as vehicles exported from America to other countries.\nThe new Nautilus will feature a redesigned exterior and new interior that includes nearly door-to-door screens for occupants in the front seats. It also offers a new feature called \"Lincoln Rejuvenate.\"\nFord describes Lincoln Rejuvenate as a \"multisensory, in-cabin experience including lighting and digital scenting.\" Lincoln revealed a\nlast year that included such features, but the Nautilus is the first production car for the U.S. to be built with the unique characteristics. The automaker has offered vehicles with the feature in China.\n\"Lincoln Rejuvenate, a stationary experience, orchestrates specially curated sensory experiences tied to lighting, screen visuals, personal preferences such as seating position and massage options — allowing clients to recharge,\" the company said in a release for the vehicle's reveal Monday night.\nScent cartridges to fill the vehicle's cabin are housed in the center armrest. The company said scents that come with the package include:\nThe vehicle will be powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine as well as a hybrid powertrain. The car is expected to go on sale in early 2024, with starting prices between $51,810 and $75,860.\nThe redesigned Nautilus and \"Lincoln Rejuvenate\" come as the once-prominent American luxury brand attempts to rejuvenate itself.\nSales of Lincoln vehicles were down by 4% last year in the U.S. to fewer than 83,500 vehicles.

Digital versions of vehicles and planes that can be modified to fine-tune their physical counterparts. And autonomous robots that move as you walk by.\nThese are just a few of the technologies that will power the factories of the future, according to technologists and industry experts who spoke with CNBC.\nIn the future, factories will be much more connected, relying on a mix of technologies, from artificial intelligence, data platforms and edge devices to the cloud, robotics and sensors, Goetz Erhardt, Europe lead for Accenture's digital engineering and manufacturing division, told CNBC.\n\"These technologies support fully automated, 'dark' plants, automated decision-making, enhanced equipment monitoring, and new production networks with recycling and upcycling capabilities,\" Erhardt said via email.\nToday's factories — from those used in machinery and automobiles to food processing plants — have progressively become more advanced with regard to adopting technology. Robotic arms involved in the manufacturing process — adding and removing materials, welding and placing goods on pallets — are now a common sight.\nAs much more advanced artificial intelligence technologies are added into the mix, the industrial manufacturing process could shake up further. Conversational systems such as OpenAI's GPT could one day become integrated into robotics, enabling more sophisticated, emotionally intelligent machines.\n\"Generative AI (AI that\nhas enormous potential in manufacturing for equipment optimization, interaction and intelligence -- from robotic processes through to machining,\" Simon Floyd, director of manufacturing and transportation industries at\nCloud, told CNBC.\nGoogle is among the tech world giants looking to capitalize on large language models, which can generate more humanlike responses thanks to the huge amounts of data they are trained on. The company\nBard earlier this year to rival OpenAI's ChatGPT.\nConsumer products aren't the only focus of Google's AI efforts. The company recently upgraded its cloud platform for manufacturers to more efficiently pull data from machines and detect anomalies in the production process.\nGoing forward, AI will be able to \"converse using natural language with manufacturing equipment to understand the current state and the predicted future performance -- therefore assisting people and allowing them to focus on high value tasks,\" Google Cloud's Floyd told CNBC.\nFloyd said that Google is already working to achieve this with natural language processing capabilities in its AI tools. The company has also created a language model for robots called PaLM-E, which gathers sensory information from the physical environment, as well as text-based inputs.\nEngineers will eventually be able to develop new machinery using generative AI tools, Floyd said.\n\"In the future, there is potential to generate content from and for many types of manufacturing equipment, ranging from specific repair instructions to software code that is tailored to a specific asset.\"\nOne development many industrialists are excited about is \"digital twins\" — 3D digital replicas of objects in the physical world that can be modified and updated in parallel with the items they aim to mimic.\nOne example of a company using digital twins to aid its physical manufacturing is\n, whose engineers create precise virtual copies of its jet engines and then install sensors and satellite networks on-board to feed back data to the digital copy in real time.\n\"For every modern Rolls Royce jet engine up on a plane in the sky, there's one in the cyber sphere that needs to be maintained, working out how much stress is going through the plane,\" said John Hill, CEO of Silico AI, a startup that focuses on digital twins for business processes. \"That will depend on how the engine is faring in the atmospheric conditions and pressures in the air.\"\nAnother example is Renault, which created a\nwith artificial intelligence capabilities to enhance services.\nDigital twins form part of the so-called \"metaverse,\" which embodies the idea that people will spend more of their work and leisure time in huge 3D digital spaces. Some companies are also looking to incorporate the physical world in some iterations of the metaverse.\nMany manufacturers see potential in the \"industrial metaverse,\" a version of the metaverse tailored to the manufacturing, construction and engineering industries. Accenture's Erhardt told CNBC that he is mainly seeing use cases in creative collaboration and product development, maintenance and remote repairs, designing and optimizing production operations, and workforce training\n\"The metaverse could become a game changer for industrial companies once they couple its collaborative, immersive, visual and intuitive dimensions with digital twins fed by integrated data pools across departments, systems, operations technology and IT,\" Erhardt said. \"This could create a virtual, fully immersive and intuitive simulation of the entire enterprise.\"\nCompanies are looking for ways to cut down on more menial tasks in factories with digital technology, amid a wave of labor shortages.\n\"Previously, automation has not been an option for manufacturing products due to minimal financial resources and investment,\" Olivier Ribet, Executive Vice President, EMEAR at\n, told CNBC.\n\"However, this is changing rapidly due to technological changes that have decreased costs and democratized automation through low/no code robotics allowing more manufacturing companies to leverage the advantages of automation in terms of precision, efficiency, and productivity.\"\nThere are downsides to consider — not least of which job security — as the rise of AI and digital automation in factories has led to worries about the labor market. Generative AI, a relatively recent development,\n,\nestimates.\nStill, history shows that\n, it also creates new roles— which typically outpaces the number of jobs displaced. Manufacturers are still scrambling for staff, with 41% of manufacturing businesses citing talent pool as a \"very significant\" barrier preventing full potential, according to a Bain and Company survey.\nThe hope is that connecting machines to the internet and integrating sensors and predictive AI algorithms will allow them to more safely navigate their surroundings and work collaboratively with humans, rather than replace them, according to Maya Pindeus, CEO of AI startup Humanising Autonomy.\n\"Think of the factory, you have robot arms, you have different vehicles to move goods around, you have operators, you have safety cameras,\" Pindeus told CNBC.\n\"What I would look at in the factory of the future is you have high levels of safe automation that can operate around people … I've been to factories where you have the big robot arm caged up and it's really far away from people.

He's opened two new Apple stores, is scheduled to meet with\n, and he's seeing sights and visiting customers in the country.\nThe international trip is the strongest sign yet that India has become a huge strategic focus for Apple as supply chains move away from China and its smartphone market is increasingly saturated with iPhone owners.\nIndia could echo the role China has played in Apple's business for the last 15 years: A massive market with an expanding middle class to power sales growth, and potentially a home base for the production of millions of Apple devices.\nAnalysts say that India's large population and maturing economy is ideally situated for Apple to make inroads by increasing marketing efforts and offering retail in the country. At the same time, India's government is eager to work closely with Apple to make it possible to manufacture in the country,\n.\nThere's room for Apple to grow on the subcontinent: Apple has less than 5% of the smartphone market share in India, versus about 18% in China, said Angelo Zino, senior analyst at CFRA research. The bulk of smartphone sales in both countries use versions of the Android operating system created by\n.\n\"As you look at India today, it's very similar to China 15 or 20 years ago,\" Zino said. \"It's really that natural wealth effect over time that's going to help Apple really penetrate and see significantly higher revenue potential in India.\"\nThe opportunity could be massive: Apple did $74 billion in sales in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan in fiscal 2022. That's about 18% of Apple's total revenue during the period.\nIndia is not there yet. It's reported in a category with other markets called \"rest of Asia Pacific,\" which reported only $29 billion in sales during the same time period.\nCorporate filings in India\nsuggest that Apple's sales in the country were about $4 billion in fiscal 2022, and Bloomberg reported earlier this week that Apple reported nearly $6 billion in sales in the year\n.\nCook has also made the India-China comparison to investors.\n\"We are, in essence, taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scale to China and bringing that to bear,\" Cook said on an earnings call earlier this year.\nIndia is the largest market that the iPhone hasn't fully cracked, meaning it is critical for sales growth.\nCook boasted in February that the company was successfully wooing \"switchers\" in the country. That's Apple's word for previous Android phone owners who have decided to buy their first iPhone. Cook said in February that Apple had its best sales quarter ever for iPhones in India in the quarter ending in December.\nIndians who buy iPhones are much more likely to be \"switchers\" than customers elsewhere because Android dominates the Indian market, led by Samsung and several Chinese brands. Android had over 95% of market share in the country,\nThe main reason is price. Most phones sold in India are\neven the least-expensive new Apple iPhone. Industry analyst IDC estimated in February that the average selling price of a smartphone in India is $224, which had increased 18% in 2022. Apple's entry level phone — the iPhone SE — retails for $429 in the U.S.\nOne way for Apple to address this gap is by allowing customers to pay for their phones in installments, or giving them a discount for trading in an older device. Cook mentioned these strategies when he was asked about India in February.\n\"There's been a lot done from financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy,\" Cook said.\nThe two physical Apple stores opening this week and the online Apple store which launched in the country in 2020 are also expected to boost sales.\nThe second part of the strategy is to build Apple products in the country, a massive project that requires not only Apple's attention, but also efforts from its manufacturing partners and local and national governments.\nNearly all iPhones are currently assembled in China, which has caused some problems over the past five years, starting with trade tensions and\nduring the Trump administration, and extending to more recent supply chain disruptions caused by Covid and China's Covid policies,\n.\nIndia could end up being a big winner as Apple looks for non-Chinese manufacturing options. In January, India's commerce minister told CNBC that Apple was manufacturing its latest iPhone 14 in the country and had a goal to produce as many\nin the country.\nApple's primary manufacturing partner, Foxconn, which oversees a large portion of the assembly of new iPhones in China, is expanding in India, too,\nbuilding a $700 million plant for iPhone parts in Bangalore.\nIn another parallel to China, the Indian government is eager to embrace Apple and use it as a symbol to attract other high tech firms to the country for manufacturing and development. Over the past 20 years, Chinese governments at multiple levels have\nto make massive factories like Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory — known as \"iPhone City\" — possible.\nModi wants to discuss Apple's plans for manufacturing around the country and creating manufacturing jobs,\n. He also wants to know about the challenges Apple has faced in growing its user base in the country.\nThis isn't the first time that investors have been excited about Apple's potential in India, and some analysts warn that it may take a while before it becomes a huge market.\n\"I've told investors this: All the all the hype you're hearing about India this week is great,\" Zino said. \"I mean, it is a massive opportunity in our view, over the next decade, but don't expect things to change overnight.\"\nApple has also faced challenges in its early experiments manufacturing in the country, most notably at a Wistron factory in Bengalaru assembling older model iPhones, which\nin late 2020.\nApple has had its eyes on an India expansion since at least 2016, when Cook\n.\nAt that meeting, Cook told Modi about the potential for manufacturing and retailing Apple goods in the country. Now, six years later, Cook is back in India to open up the company's first two owned-and-operated retail stores.\nApple was bullish on India back then, too: \"India will be the most populous country in the world in 2022,\" Cook\nat the time, saying it had \"huge market potential.\"\nApple's long-term strategy in India is best summarized by a quote Cook gave to local media during his 2016 trip to the subcontinent.\n\"We are putting enormous energy in here, and we are not here for a quarter, or two quarters, or the next quarter, or the next year, or the next year, we are here for a thousand years,\" Cook\n."},
