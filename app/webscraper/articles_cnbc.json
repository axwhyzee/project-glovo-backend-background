Carlson was\nfrom his prime time post at Fox News weeks ago, shortly after the network paid a settlement to Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation lawsuit.\nIn a three minute video, Carlson – who has worked for CNN, MSNBC and Fox News – berated the mainstream media for allegedly lying to the public. He told viewers: \"You are being manipulated.\" Carlson also said Twitter isn't partisan.\n\"Amazingly, as of tonight, there aren't many platforms left that allow free speech. The last big one remaining in the world, the only one, is Twitter, where we are now,\" Carlson said in Tuesday's video. \"Twitter has long served as the place where our national conversation incubates and develops. Twitter is not a partisan site, everybody's allowed here, and we think that's a good thing.\"\nA Fox representative didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A Twitter spokesperson responded with a poop emoji when asked for comment on Tuesday.\n\"On this platform, unlike the one-way street of broadcast, people are able to interact, critique and refute whatever he or anyone may say,\" Musk\non Tuesday. He added \"we have not signed a deal of any kind whatsoever. Tucker is subject to the same rules & rewards of all content creators.\"\n\"I hope that many others, particularly from the left, also choose to be content creators on this platform,\" Musk said in the tweet.\nCarlson's shift to Twitter comes as former President Donald Trump is running for election again in 2024. In the wake of President Joe Biden's triumph over Trump in 2020, both media outlets and social media platforms are contending with the spread of false claims about the most recent election.\nFox agreed to pay $787.5 million to settle Dominion's defamation lawsuit that the network and its hosts spread false claims about the election. Fox faces a similar lawsuit with voting machine tech company Smartmatic USA.\nCarlson has not publicly addressed his firing from Fox News, although he\ndays after he was booted from the network, also in a video posted on his Twitter feed. \"When you take a little time off, you realize how unbelievably stupid the debates you see on television are, they're completely irrelevant,\" he said during his April 26 video.\nSince then, various media reports have emerged saying that text messages from Carlson, including a racist remark about how \"white men\" fight, sealed his fate at Fox. The texts were unearthed during the discovery process in the Dominion defamation case.\nIn recent days, unredacted portions of evidence from the Dominion lawsuit have come out in media reports, which have also said Carlson was pushing the network to let him find his own platform. Carlson was\na contract dispute with Fox, which is said to last through 2025, and was said to have had discussions with Musk.\nCarlson's last show on Fox aired on Friday, April 21. The following Monday, Fox said in a statement: \"FOX News Media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways. We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor.\"\nFox has seen its prime-time ratings dip since Carlson's exit, although top advertisers have returned to the timeslot for the network. Carlson's program was among one of the highest rated cable TV segments. Fox still touts being the top-rated cable news network, which CEO Lachlan Murdoch\non Tuesday's earnings call with investors.\nMeanwhile, much smaller networks like Newsmax have seen a stark increase in viewership since Carlson has gone off Fox's air, according to Nielsen ratings data.\nIn his last week on Fox News, Carlson hosted Musk on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"\nDuring the interview, which aired over two nights,\nwhether he thought Twitter would weigh heavily in future elections as it had for Trump. \"I think it will play a significant role in elections, not just domestically but internationally,\" Musk told Carlson.\nMeanwhile, Warner Bros. Discovery's CNN will hold\nwith Trump. The network has vowed to hold Trump accountable, with CEO David Zaslav saying as the Republican frontrunner, Trump has to be on air."},

The stock hovered around that level in early trading Friday, giving the company a market value of roughly $50 billion.\nKenvue, spun out of\n, carries a\nof widely known brands, such as Band-Aid, Tylenol, Listerine, Neutrogena, Aveeno and J&J's namesake baby powder.\nTen of Kenvue's brands booked approximately $400 million or more in sales last year, according to a\nthe company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week.\nBut Mongon told CNBC that Kenvue's portfolio of brands has \"ample opportunity\" to grow.\nThe company's plans for product innovation involve new science and technologies to develop new products that meet the specific needs of consumers in a way that hasn't been done before, according to Mongon.\nKenvue has a team of around 1,500 research and development professionals who identify new ways to enhance a given product.\nMongon believes product innovation ultimately makes Kenvue's brands \"more relevant than ever\" to consumers as they better target their needs.\n\"There is no limit for you to take care of your health in a better way and there is no limit for us to invent products and solutions to help you do that,\" Mongon told CNBC.\nAs an example, Mongon pointed to a sunscreen launched under the Neutrogena brand. The company designed the product,\n, to blend into the skin without creating the unflattering chalky white residue most sunscreens leave behind, eliminating a consumer pain point for applying the protection.\nAs a result, Mongon said, that product could reach consumers who may not regularly use traditional sunscreen.\n\"That's our contribution to the world. To provide these consumers with a solution: Strong sun protection but also great aesthetics,\" Mongon said. \"That should make more people use sunscreen on a regular basis, which we know is so important for the skin.\"\nThe company has launched more than 100 new product innovations each year since 2020, according to the company's prospectus. Product innovations launched during the last three years have accounted for around $1.5 billion of Kenvue's net sales, the company said in its filing.\nMongon said the company will \"keep pushing the envelope\" to launch new products in the upcoming years.\nKenvue will use a \"digital-first approach\" to deliver more personalized experiences with the company's brands, according to Mongon. That includes new e-commerce and direct-to-consumer services.\nThe brand Zyrtec, for example, has its own\ncalled \"AllergyCast.\" Zyrtec is a drug designed to relieve allergy symptoms such as watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing and itching.\nMongon said Kenvue designed the app to help consumers manage their allergies, allowing them to track pollen levels and their allergy symptoms. The app can ultimately predict how severe a given consumer's allergies will be based on their location, weather conditions and symptom history.\n\"You will receive messages that allow you to understand and manage your symptoms better,\" Mongon told CNBC. \"That's part of the innovation that we focus on at Kenvue.\"\nKenvue also designed the\ndigital ear scope under the brand Tylenol, a medicine that reduces fever and treats minor aches and pains.\nSmartCheck is a personal ear scope device and app that turns a smartphone into an otoscope, which is used to look into ears. The app allows users to take a recording of a child's potentially infected eardrum and send it to a healthcare provider or telehealth service for diagnosis.\nBut Kenvue noted in the preliminary prospectus that continuing to expand service and product offerings through \"digital initiatives\" may expose the company to additional risks, including potential technical failures, cybersecurity incidents and consumer privacy and data protection concerns.\nWhen asked about the potential for mergers and acquisitions, Mongon said Kenvue is primarily focused on organic growth.\nBut he said the company isn't completely ruling out M&A in the future.\nHe noted that Kenuve has a strong track record of identifying the right brands in the market that could complement the company's portfolio in a positive way.\n\"If we see an opportunity that makes sense strategically and financially we will move thanks to the healthy balance sheets that we have,\" Mongon said.\nKenvu recorded total assets of more than $27 billion as of Jan. 1, on a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of the costs associated with the public offering, and total liabilities of roughly $16 billion.\nThe company recorded total debt of around $9 billion as of the start of the year.\nKenvue raked in $14.95 billion in sales for 2022 and a net income of $1.46 billion on a pro forma basis, according to the preliminary prospectus.\nKenvue trades under the stock ticker \"KVUE.\""},

Disney says the contracts were crafted to help lock in its long-term development plans amid escalating tension with DeSantis and his allies.\nMembers of both parties, including Trump, have criticized DeSantis' fight with Disney.\n\"This feud between DeSantis and Disney is insane,\" Linda Stewart, a Democrat who represents Florida's 13th Senate district, told CNBC. \"Every day it seems like there's another way that they want to try to make things more difficult for Disney, but all they're doing is costing taxpayers money to hire lawyers to go defend what they are doing.\"\nStewart voted against the recent legislation.\nDisney sued DeSantis and the board members last week, alleging a campaign of political retaliation led by the governor. The board countersued days later.\nDisney declined to comment.\nThe feud began more than a year ago, after Disney denounced a Republican-backed Florida bill limiting classroom discussion about sexual orientation and gender ideology, branded \"Don't Say Gay\" by critics.\nShortly after, DeSantis and his allies moved to dissolve the special tax district that had allowed Walt Disney World to essentially govern its own operations since the 1960s.\nThe 25,000-acre area, formerly called the Reedy Creek Improvement District, was ultimately kept intact — but it was given a new name, and its five-member board was replaced with figures picked by DeSantis.\nIn March, the new board accused Disney of crafting 11th-hour deals that undercut its power. Disney says its contacts were forged publicly, and that they don't undermine the board's oversight of the district's operations.\nThe company's federal civil lawsuit asks the court to \"stop the State of Florida from weaponizing the power of government to punish private business.\"\nDeSantis signed the bill voiding Disney's deals on the\nof Florida's 2023 legislative session. The governor, who was resoundingly reelected in the November midterms, is seen as former President Donald Trump's top potential rival for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\nThe Legislature, which bears Republican supermajorities in both chambers, churned out bills that helped enact DeSantis' wide-ranging conservative agenda — with a focus on divisive cultural issues that could resonate in a Republican primary race.\nDeSantis has kept up his attacks on Disney, even as the drawn-out fight has led some Republicans to question his strategy.\nIn addition to voiding the development deals, the Florida Legislature passed a measure that would have the state transportation department conduct inspections of Walt Disney World's monorails. Stewart said Disney hasn't had any major safety issues with its monorail system since 2009, when\nafter two of the vehicles collided. She called into question the timing of the new measure.\n\"It's so obvious this is about retaliation,\" Stewart said.\nEarlier this month, the state education board approved an\nof the classroom bill that kicked off the feud with Disney."},

And, for once, the success of a Marvel film could bode well for the future of its longtime adversary.\nThe new film is expected to generate between $120 million and $155 million domestically during its upcoming opening weekend, on par with the 2017 release of \"Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2,\" which went on to snare $870 million globally, according to data from Comscore.\nThe success of \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" would show that Gunn has his finger on the pulse, and has the potential to deliver similar results over at DC Studios, where he was named co-CEO last year.\nWhile Marvel has clearly seen greater box-office success in the last decade, generating $28.7 billion in global ticket sales from 31 feature films since 2008, industry experts don't count out DC. The DC Extended Universe, which released 12 films since 2013, saw box-office returns of $6.4 billion and built ardent fan bases for writer-director Zack Snyder and live-action versions of characters like Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie).\nChanges are coming to both studios, as attendance at cinemas has lagged in the wake of the pandemic and Marvel and DC look to lure back audiences with captivating and innovative storytelling. Their parent companies are also looking to lean more into franchises while cutting spending in other areas of their businesses. And while Marvel has remained under the steady stewardship of Kevin Feige, DC looks to find new footing under new leadership.\n\"It is not a oppositional relationship,\" said Brandon Katz, an industry strategist at Parrot Analytics, of the perceived rivalry between Marvel and DC. \"I actually think it's additive.\"\nGunn has been one of several creative shepherds for Marvel since \"Iron Man\" hit theaters and kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2008. Gunn's first film with Marvel, \"Guardians of the Galaxy,\" saw a ragtag team of intergalactic criminals turn into reluctant heroes.\nWhile some saw the idea of a gun-toting raccoon and a talking tree teaming up in a tent pole Disney film as potentially disastrous, Gunn's script, packed with comedy and heart, went on to generate $770 million globally in 2014.\nThe writer-director took a brief hiatus from working with Marvel, after tweets resurfaced in which he made jokes about pedophilia and molestation. During this time, he teamed up with DC to write and direct \"The Suicide Squad,\" another film about a ragtag group of antiheroes, although this time Gunn tapped into his edgier side and netted an R rating. Eventually, Gunn was rehired by Disney to write and helm \"Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3,\" which would be his last venture with Marvel Studios.\nIn November, Gunn and producer Peter Safran,\nand have since developed a 10-year plan to reinvigorate its franchises across TV and film,\nThe duo have worked together previously on projects and bring extensive industry experience to the comic book studio. Gunn, in addition to working at Marvel, has a long career in Hollywood and the indie film world, with screenwriting credits for movies like \"Scooby Doo\" and Snyder's \"Dawn of the Dead\" remake. He also directed subversive genre films like \"Slither\" and \"Super,\" and wrote \"Tromeo and Juliet\" for schlock studio Troma.\nSafran began as a talent manager before transitioning into producing, helping to launch The Conjuring Universe, a lucrative franchise of interconnected horror films. He also produced a handful of DC titles including \"Aquaman,\" \"Shazam\" and Gunn's \"The Suicide Squad.\"\nIndustry experts see Gunn and Safran as a potential dynamic duo.\n\"I think between the two of them there is a certain level of experience in those worlds to be able to shepherd a lot of untapped potential in DC,\" said Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. \"Gunn has shown that he can succeed in both Marvel and DC. That speaks to being able to transcend a brand. It comes down to his understanding of character and his understanding of what the audience is looking for. So, I think there's reason to be confident.\"\nDC's new strategy includes creating a cohesive universe like Marvel's while still making unique \"elsewhere\" content, where characters and storylines do not need to be connected to one overarching narrative.\nThe studio has seen success from these solo ventures with films like 2019's \"Joker\" and 2022's \"The Batman\" as well as its television content, which airs on The CW and via the streaming service Max.\n\"The upside of [DC] being a little bit more Wild, Wild West over the last decade is that their shows have kind of run the gamut of tone, genre and style,\" said Katz.\nThis has allowed the studio to provide content for different audiences and demographics.\n\"'The Flash' is as different from 'Doom Patrol' which is as different as 'Harley Quinn,'\" he said.\nGunn and Safran will continue that tradition, but with their own stamp on it. Upcoming TV content includes an animated show featuring \"Suicide Squad\" character Amanda Waller forming a black-ops team of monstrous prisoners, a \"True Detective\"-style Green Lantern show centered on intergalactic cops John Stewart and Hal Jordan, and a \"Game of Thrones\"-style show set in Themyscira, home of the Amazons and birthplace of Wonder Woman.\nOn the theatrical side, DC Studios has announced five new projects that will roll out starting in 2025 with Gunn's own \"Superman: Legacy.\" There will also be a new take on Batman, with Damian Wayne, the son of Bruce Wayne, taking on the role of Robin. DC also plans a Supergirl film, another centered on Swamp Thing and one about superhero team, The Authority.\nDC isn't the only one undergoing a major reinvention. Marvel, which has faced some audience criticism for what it's released after the much-praised \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Avengers: Endgame\" films, is seeking to recoup goodwill from fans and more box-office business.\nDisney CEO Bob Iger even\n, rather than exploring new heroes, antiheroes and villains. His comments, which were delivered in March during the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, came on the heels of the disappointing box-office performance of \"Ant-Man and the Wasp in Quantumania\" and \"Thor: Love and Thunder.\"\nDisney has been releasing new content from the MCU at a somewhat frenetic pace over the past few years. The entertainment giant has used streaming service Disney+ as a vehicle to introduce new characters — Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk — as well as to more deeply explore legacy characters (Loki, Falcon, the Winter Soldier) between theatrical releases.\nAs the MCU grows, some have rallied behind the franchise, excited for new entrants and content. Others have found the required viewing of additional series to be arduous. It seems Marvel took the hint, pushing its release of \"The Marvels\" to November from July, allowing space for \"Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3\" to breathe across the summer movie season.\nStill, industry analysts say the recent slump at the box office and critical reception for MCU films isn't something to worry about. After all, Robbins said, it's happened before.\nIn the wake of 2012's \"Avengers,\" which shattered theatrical records at the time, fans expressed disappointment in follow-up films \"Iron Man 3\" and \"Thor: The Dark World.\" While the third solo Iron Man film tallied $1.2 billion at the global box office, the second Thor feature secured just $644 million, a relatively small sum in comparison to previous Marvel hits.\n\"They've set such a standard for themselves,\" Robbins said. \"It's impossible to keep living up to it every single time.\"\nOf course, the post-\"Endgame\" landscape was also mired by the pandemic, which shuttered theaters for a time, and led to some Marvel releases going day-and-date with streaming service Disney+ for a fee.\nBut the $854 million in ticket sales for 2022's \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" fly in the face of claims about superhero fatigue. Even the paltry $464 million in receipts for the most recent MCU film \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\" says more about film quality than a disinterest in the genre, experts say.\n\"When you deliver something that's historic, like 'Infinity War' and 'Endgame,' you are setting up a bar that fans are going to expect you to at least hit or get near with every one of your projects,\" said Erik Davis, managing director at Fandango.\nMarvel has laid the groundwork in the wake of \"Endgame\" to establish a new team of Avengers, including Shang-Chi, Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk, Moon Knight and America Chavez, as well as a team of antiheroes in the form of the Thunderbolts.\nThere is confidence from industry analysts that Marvel will right its ship in the coming years. Katz noted that unexpected heroes – like Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy – are the bedrock of the MCU.\n\"Marvel Studios, out of necessity, cultivated A-list appeal from B-list characters,\" he said.\nStill, the road ahead is anything but smooth for Marvel and DC. Both studios are dealing with major cast-related scandals and a not-yet rebounded theatrical industry. It has also yet to be seen how the current Writers Guild of America strike will affect TV and film production.\nWhile initial social media reviews out of CinemaCon suggest that \"The Flash\" is a return to form for DC Studios, controversy surrounding star Ezra Miller could complicate the future for the character of Barry Allen and the connected tissue of Gunn and Safran's new DC Universe.\nLast year, Miller admitted they had \"gone through a time of intense crisis\" and would undergo treatment for \"complex mental health issues\" in the way of being charged with felony burglary in Stamford, Vermont. While Miller\n, their future at DC remains uncertain.\nEarly indications from Warner Bros. suggested that the distributor would still send the film to theaters, but future projects with the actor would be paused. It is unclear whether Miller will be able to reestablish enough goodwill with fans and the studio to secure themselves another chance to return.\nAt Marvel, there are similar issues regarding Jonathan Majors, the actor who has portrayed the MCU's newest overarching villain Kang. Multiple alleged abuse victims have come forward following the actor's March arrest in Manhattan for domestic violence.\nMajors' attorney, Priya Chaudhry, has repeatedly defended her client, telling the press that he is \"innocent,\" \"has not abused anyone\" and \"will be fully exonerated.\" Majors is set to appear in court on May 8.\nWhile the character of Kang appeared in the \"Loki\" series and was an integral part of \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\" the expectation is that the villain won't make a major theatrical return until \"Avengers: The Kang Dynasty\" and, potentially, \"Avengers: Secret Wars,\" due out in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\nThis could allow Marvel time to wait and see how Majors' legal problems pan out, but sooner or later, the studio will be forced to address the issue. Especially, considering how far in advance these films need to be shot in order for special effects to be added.\nThere is also the unanswered question about the future of Spider-Man within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney has managed to broker deals in the past with Sony, which owns the rights to the character, to have Spidey appear in MCU films. However, after \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" it's unclear when Peter Parker played by Tom Holland will return.\n\"I think Spider-Man is the most popular and the most lucrative character right now on the big screen,\" Davis said. \"And I think Marvel Studios, sooner rather than later, needs to tell us what's going on with Spider-Man.\"\nDavis suggested Disney could be holding out on making any announcements until ComicCon in San Diego this July.\nWhile there is general optimism from industry experts about the future of both studios, there remains some hesitancy that Gunn will be a silver bullet for DC Studios.\n\"There is a famous quote by William Goldman in his classic book, 'Adventures in the Screen Trade.' The quote is that when it comes to predicting movie success, 'nobody knows anything,'\" Mark Young, a professor at the Marshall School of Business at USC, wrote in an email to CNBC.\n\"Clearly, Mr. Gunn is extremely talented, but I don't think we can assume that a success of a movie at another studio will necessarily translate into future success at another,\" he said. \"Certainly DC is betting that he will be successful and by all accounts he will be.\"\nYoung, who teaches classes on the entertainment industry, said his students have discussed feeling the effects of superhero fatigue in classes. He sees this as the result of predictable plotlines within the genre that are repeated across both studios' films.\nWith Gunn at the helm of DC, there is promise of a more unique slate of films and television shows. He's already proven with his Guardians of the Galaxy films (and a holiday special), \"The Suicide Squad\" and \"Peacemaker\" that he can freshen up the genre.\n\"Where Marvel and DC unfortunately find themselves aligned is with a seeming creative malaise that has resulted in a noticeable pushback from fans who are not simply willing to follow every superhero movie into the multiplex,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore.\n\"That said, the superhero genre is one that will always have appeal for audiences looking for the among the most epic of big screen experiences and with endless creative possibilities and incredible talent on both the Marvel and DC teams, no one should give up on either of these companies adjust strategies and deliver the creative and financial goods moving forward,\" he added.\nAnd even with this malaise, many industry experts told CNBC that the strong track records from Marvel and Gunn bode well for the genre.\n\"I am not remotely ready to bet against Kevin Feige, who helped engineer the single-most consistently successful creation in Hollywood history,\" Katz said. \"I think if there's ever someone to to leave this next phase of DC it's a unique, singular voice like James Gunn, who just spent the better part of a decade learning under Kevin Feige.\""},

Ron DeSantis as he sets the tone for his anticipated presidential campaign announcement.\nDeSantis, who is widely seen as former President\n's top rival for the 2024 Republican nomination, has long been expected to reveal his political plans after the session adjourns. He could announce a presidential exploratory committee as soon as mid-May, NBC News\nlast week.\nIf he enters the race, DeSantis will ride into the presidential fray on a wave of new state policy that enacts much of the governor's conservative wish list.\nFlorida's GOP supermajorities in the House and Senate largely made good on their\nto get DeSantis' agenda \"across the finish line,\" passing bills on issues ranging from abortion to guns to school vouchers.\nThe Legislature leaned into polarizing cultural fights that have helped elevate the governor nationally, bolstering his efforts to craft an image of a leader who takes on hot-button topics and delivers conservative outcomes. Measures such as the restrictive abortion law DeSantis signed could help him in a GOP primary, but may reduce his appeal in a general election.\nLawmakers have also passed multiple measures that could help clear DeSantis' path to the White House, if and when he decides to run.\nThe Legislature voted last week to carve out a DeSantis-shaped\nto the state's \"\n\" law, by allowing candidates for president or vice president to run without giving up their jobs in Florida. Another measure effectively\nDeSantis' travel records from public view.\n\"The entire session was focused on Governor DeSantis' run for president,\" said Jim Clark, a University of Central Florida senior lecturer and political commentator, in an interview. \"The legislature gave him 99% of what he wanted.\"\nWhile a Republican\nhas empowered DeSantis in Florida, he has come under\nfrom Trump and appears to be trending lower in\nof the possible primary field, raising\nabout his appeal outside his state.\n\"It seems to me that the more the voters get to know Ron DeSantis, the more problems he has,\" Clark said.\nThe 2024 contest is in its early stages, as more\ntrickle into the primary months before the first Republican\n. DeSantis also holds a major\nedge over most of his potential opponents, and some big names on Wall Street are considering\nthe governor if he runs.\nRepublicans gained two-thirds majorities in Florida's House and Senate in the November midterm elections, when Democrats broadly underperformed across the state. With the Legislature and governor's mansion in political alignment and facing few obstacles, state lawmakers churned through legislation with unprecedented speed.\n\"Once it was gaveled in, it was full steam ahead,\" veteran Florida political analyst Susan MacManus told CNBC.\nDeSantis, in turn, quickly signed many of his priorities into law, all while he released a biographical book and toured the country in early steps toward a presidential run.\nAmong the most controversial new Florida laws is a\non most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, which will not take effect until after a previous 15-week ban is resolved in the courts.\nThe move ensures abortion, a top issue in the last election cycle after the Supreme Court\nRoe v. Wade, will again be front and center in the 2024 presidential race. President\nin his reelection\nrailed against Trump-aligned \"extremists\" trying to control \"what health care decisions women can make,\" while Republican contender Nikki Haley called for \"\n\" in an abortion-focused stump speech.\nDeSantis also signed legislation allowing Floridians to carry concealed\nwithout a permit. He signed both the abortion and gun bills with\nin private settings, facts that critics have noted as they highlight the lack of support for both measures in polls.\nOn top of those issues, DeSantis in March waded into the \"school choice\" debate by signing a bill\nFlorida's school voucher system. Supporters of school-choice initiatives say they give some students needed educational options, while critics say they hurt public schools. Vouchers are just one front in a wide-ranging battle about parents' and children's rights that also encompasses\nand\n.\nMacManus said she expects that battle will be a major theme of the 2024 election.\nSeparately, DeSantis on Monday signed a bill making child rapists eligible for the death penalty. He vowed to defend the law up to the Supreme Court, which had\ncapital punishment in such cases.\nA day later, he signed\nrestricting state and local entities from giving preference to the investing movement known as\n. The nascent campaign, which broadly refers to investing strategies that prioritize environmental, social and governance factors, has become a target for conservative critics alleging progressive overreach by major corporations.\nThe supermajority's full-court press to pass legislation from the opening gavel to the end of the session may be unusual, but it's not surprising, MacManus said.\n\"You have to strike while the iron's hot and that's why elections matter,\" she said.\n\"Democrats are well aware that their inability to make improvements in their representation in the legislature now [is] coming home to haunt them,\" MacManus added.\nGOP lawmakers have also backed DeSantis in his protracted fight with\nstemming from the law that critics have dubbed \"Don't Say Gay.\" The governor's feud with one of his state's largest employers has presidential undertones, as Republicans increasingly seek political appeal by targeting companies that take stances on social issues.\nThe battle began more than one year ago when Disney, under pressure from activists and many of its own employees, opposed the bill, which limits classroom discussion about sexual orientation and gender ideology.\nSoon after, DeSantis and his allies\nto dissolve the decades-old special tax district that had allowed Disney's Orlando-area parks to essentially govern themselves. The governor's actions stoked fears residents of the neighboring counties could be on the hook for a\nbill.\nIn February, lawmakers approved a new plan that left the district largely intact, but allowed DeSantis to handpick its board of supervisors. But the new board complained before they were seated, Disney struck a development agreement that effectively\n.\nThe governor's board members then voted to undo Disney's deal, alleging it was unlawful. Disney\nDeSantis and the board in federal court, accusing the governor of orchestrating a campaign of political retribution against the company for its speech. The board\nin state court days later.\nDeSantis' possible GOP primary rivals have taken shots at the governor over his fixation on Disney, especially as the imbroglio drags into the courts. Some other Republicans have questioned the governor's tactics. \"I think it'd be much better if you sat down and solved the problems,\" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" last week.\nDeSantis' side seems undeterred. GOP legislators passed measures as recently as this week that single out Walt Disney World and further flex the state's power over the company.\nOn Wednesday, Republican lawmakers passed a bill that would void Disney's development agreement. DeSantis is expected to sign it into law.\nThe Legislature also passed a measure that would have the state transportation department conduct inspections of Walt Disney World's monorails.\nEarlier this month, the state education board approved an\nof the controversial classroom bill at the root of the spat with Disney. The new rules extend the ban on classroom instruction of sexual orientation to high school grades.\n\"This bill is not really about protecting children and educators. This bill is about discrimination against people who are different than you are,\" the state Senate's leading Democrat, Lauren Book, said of the bill she called \"Don't Say Gay 2.0.\"\nDeSantis is leaning further into measures that have angered LGBTQ+ activists. He is also likely to sign just-passed\ntargeting college diversity programs and limiting the use of preferred pronouns in schools. State Republicans have also approved a bill that would make it an offense for people to use certain bathrooms that don't match their sex at birth. Transgender\nthe bill, dubbed the \"Safety in Private Spaces Act,\" puts them in danger.\nIt continues a trend for DeSantis, whose willingness to wield his power for right-wing cultural causes has made him a Republican darling and top name in the presidential rumor mill.\nHis moves could play well in a Republican primary, where candidates will likely spar over who has the most conservative record on those issues.\nDeSantis' agenda was stymied on a few key issues.\nLegislation that would have weakened media protections against defamation claims was apparently shelved in what was\nas a blow to the governor. A bill that would lower the minimum rifle-buying age to 18\nin the state House, but faced opposition from the Republican Senate president, Kathleen Passidomo.\nDeSantis has nevertheless racked up a long list of political accomplishments in a condensed period, potentially giving him a firmer footing from which to launch a presidential bid. MacManus said if the Legislature's goal was to help DeSantis tee up a White House bid, it did its job.\nYet, it isn't clear if DeSantis is better positioned for a presidential run than he was 60 days ago.\nIn addition to passing his conservative-friendly agenda, the governor recently embarked on a campaign-style book tour touting his wins, released glossy videos hyping his state's \"blueprint\" for success and even went overseas to meet with world leaders.\nBut his polling gap with Trump, the current frontrunner for the 2024 nomination, has never been wider, according to\n's primary polling tracker. The pugilistic ex-president has homed in on DeSantis as his top rival and has spent weeks lambasting the governor on everything from his record in office to his personality. DeSantis has been less willing to strike back at Trump, who remains the Republican Party's de facto leader and commands loyalty from a large swath of its voters.\n\"This is really strange,\" Clark said. \"We're talking about a man who won 60% of the vote in Florida, and yet outside of Florida has had trouble connecting with people.\"\nClark said the situation put him in mind of a classic episode of the long-running cartoon \"The Simpsons,\" where Homer Simpson becomes a beloved mascot for his town's baseball team. He's then recruited as the mascot for a much larger city's team, but his antics fall flat on the bigger stage.\n\"I keep thinking on that,\" Clark said."},

The former chair of the group's board was Anthony Connelly, who was once the president of Disney's Cruise Line. Disney also donated over $400,000 during the 2010 election cycle to a pair of political committees run by the chamber, according to the Orlando Sentinel.\nLast month, the chamber\nWalt Disney World donated $100,000 to support STEM education in Florida. It highlighted Rena Langley, an executive at the\nmassive Florida theme park\nand a longtime member of the chamber's board.\nThe chamber has also tried to stay on the good side of DeSantis, who has largely promoted policies that companies support, but nonetheless waged a protracted fight against one of Florida's biggest economic drivers. The group and many of its board members have also backed the governor's campaigns, according to campaign finance records and statements reviewed by CNBC.\nBut as Disney and DeSantis descend into an increasingly venomous fight, the state chamber has not defended or criticized either side. The business lobbying group has yet to weigh in on the dispute on its website.\nDavid Jolly, who while a Republican member of Congress represented Florida's 13th congressional district, told CNBC the state chamber is among the business groups allied with DeSantis and Disney, putting the lobbying organization into a tough position.\n\"The entire business and lobbying class are allies of both DeSantis and Disney,\" said Jolly, who is now an MSNBC political analyst and has left the GOP. \"The chamber's political division is probably the premier ally of the state GOP in producing polling and research in low-dollar state House seats, and also mobilizes soft dollars around state legislative races.\"\nThe Florida Chamber of Commerce declined to comment.

Google parent Alphabet\nlast month that its board had approved $70 billion in stock buybacks this year, matching the amount the company spent repurchasing its own shares in 2022.

What's it about?

It's less dramatic. There's a lot of dead time. The imaginary pandemic that I created was a sweeping cloud of death that descends on planet Earth, where it's actually a slow, grinding dispiriting thing that takes place over longer periods of time. There are moments of deep crisis, and then there's lots of paperwork.\nMetaphorically, it corresponds to ways catastrophe has changed in my lifetime. ... Global catastrophe as I grew up with it was something swift, all-encompassing and total, and it took about 40 minutes. A global nuclear exchange of the kind I grew up thinking about, by the time I was an adult, was off the table. It's not going to happen. There was a very specific arrangement, military and political, that's no longer there. What we do have is these sort of slow-motion catastrophes, and they're just as devastating. But they're also in some ways harder to defend against because you can ignore them for a really, really long time.\nThey have no motive to change. Everything that's wrong with the world is solvable. Climate change is solvable. We have all this technology. We can do it tomorrow. But there's no political will or political structure to make that happen because of the upward flow of capital to a very narrow bandwidth of people. I don't mean to sound like a revolutionary on CNBC, but this is a story through history that has never ended well. It never ends well.\nIn the novel, you have this island society of the haves. And then you have, adjacent to it, crammed into substandard housing, being paid very low wages, a population that's four or five times that size, and some people have to drink the wine and some people have to pour the wine. There are many more of them than there are of — the term has been lost — the leisure class. We don't use that term anymore. ... That's the world we're living in. It gets worse by the hour.\nIt's not just going to be menial tasks. I'm in a college English department. Everybody is asking what we do about ChatGPT and student papers. I'm like, who cares? We need to think about where this is going to be in about five years or 10 years, after it's spent a decade here interacting with the entire data structure of the human species. For instance, I'm glad that my career as a novelist has maybe another 10 years in it. Some point I'm going to do something else. Writers do retire! Because I think an enormous amount of cultural content, from film to novels and so on will be produced rapidly and on the cheap by artificial intelligence.\nI know people like all the people in the book. I had no money for many years, to be perfectly clear. And so I've known and befriended and had a life populated by people from every corner of the economy. As a writer, you need to walk a lot of different streets, in a lot of different ways, to know this stuff. What you learn to do is become a good observer of human behavior in general. If you look at a problem like the spasms of — your readers may hate the term — late-stage capitalism, sooner or later, you make the poor broke and they can't buy anything you're selling.\nI don't know. One of the things is that we are changed by technology. Something comes along and it rewrites the rules. Even where political will is absent, even where there are strong disincentives to change, things come along and make it happen.\nAll the rules have been rewritten for everything. You can't even walk into a restaurant right now and read the menu without your phone. We have mandated these technologies in people's lives in order for them to function, and it's digging new neural pathways. I look at my kids, and I know their brains work differently. This was exacerbated by Covid, which played right into the hands of this change, making us into this species of screen-starers.\nI think all the problems we're facing now, we're going to face in increasing amounts until something catastrophic happens. Except for the fact that I have no idea what AI is going to do, and all bets are off. All bets are off.\nNo, I wasn't thinking explicitly about that. It's a technology that's being relied upon within the world of the novel, superfast, supersmart computing. It's just taken for granted that we got past that danger, but we didn't get past climate change as a danger. Pick your catastrophe! It's a pretty long menu. I couldn't write about all of them at the same time.\nThe social concerns of the book, and the more abstract, cosmic concerns of the book move in tandem. The anxieties that I have about what's going to happen in the next 20, 30 years, these are concerns that I'm handing off to the next generation. And they'll hand it off to their kids, and so on. The celestial concerns of the book, of which there are plenty, I think they're just deep, human questions that exist outside any particular social discourse.\nThat was something of a model for this. On the one hand, I as a boy was promised — was\n— that we would have conquered space by now. Born in 1962, watched the moon landing on a black-and-white TV. We were going to be on Mars by the mid-70s. \"Star Trek\" was real. \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" flying to Jupiter. It's a vast disappointment to me, personally, that we haven't conquered outer space.\nIs there a reason I should care about this? No. I just do. But having said that, Elon Musk's Starship, this gleaming bullet of a spacecraft, that's the spaceship I was promised. The image of that spacecraft, the way it actually looks, is on the cover of most of the pulp sci-fi I read as a kid. It is deeply thrilling to me in a way that doesn't make a lot of sense.\nWe have other problems to be solved, to be perfectly honest. My wife is quick to point out how much of an empty testosterone fest this is. Do we really need to go settle on the moon or Mars? I think it would be interesting if we did, and it would change our sense of ourselves a little bit. But, how about free school lunches?\nI've done it longer than that. When I was a kid I knew everything about the Cold War and I was an armchair expert on every single weapon system. I had a copy of one of the foundational documents, called \"The Effects of Nuclear War,\" which was prepared for [Congress]. I knew all of it. I could tell you about every missile, how it worked. ... That's because I was quite convinced it was going to happen. So I'm the household catastrophist. When Covid hit, I was like, we're turning on the Justin Catastrophe Machine, let's go. I was such a general. Drove my wife nuts.\nSo it's actually kind of a permanent state of affairs. I still can take a walk on a stormy night and play tennis with my friend and ride my bike on the weekends and swim in the sea and enjoy the company of my children. But there is always a background hum and there has been since I was a kid, since my father declared over dinner that he was pretty sure that a nuclear weapon would be detonated in an American city during his lifetime, certainly, and pass the butter. And I was probably in middle school when he said this. And he was my father. He knew everything. He lets this one drop, and so a catastrophist is born."},

For\nsubsidiary Millennium the mission will be just the 14th satellite it's flown to date, and for Firefly it's only the third launch of its rocket.\nThe challenge of this mission lies in its unique requirements for the companies, Lt. Col. MacKenzie Birchenough, leader of the Tactically Responsive Space program within Space Safari, explained to CNBC.\n\"They don't know when they're going to get the call to launch,\" she said. \"From their perspective, the things that normally happen over weeks or months are now crunched down to basically minutes and days.\"\nBirchenough and the Tactically Responsive Space, or TacRS, program aim to work with spacecraft and rocket builders to create \"the capability to quickly respond to on-orbit needs\" on \"very short timelines.\"\nSpace Force is keen to continue pushing the limits of satellites and rockets with more TacRS missions, with its most recent budget request outlining $60 million over the next two years for the program.\nVictus Nox is a \"space domain awareness mission,\" Birchenough said, which effectively means it's a satellite intended to track other objects in orbit, as well as predict possible space threats.\n\"This whole mission is based off what a real-world situation would be like, and making sure that this operational demo is as close to that as we can possibly get,\" she said.\nFirefly CEO Bill Weber acknowledged that, while the space domain is becoming increasingly privatized, \"it's not enough to truly call the commercialization of space 'responsive.'\"\n\"We don't have that ability right now for anything other than weapon systems. In space, we do not have the ability within a near-term time frame to respond\" to a national security threat or crisis, Weber said.\nSpace Force selected Firefly and Millennium for the Victus Nox contract in October, setting off a chain of events starting with the build phase. Firefly's contract for the mission is worth $17.6 million, while Millennium's contract value was not disclosed.\nNext up is the \"hot standby\" phase, in which Millennium waits to receive a 60-hour window to get the spacecraft from Los Angeles to the launch site at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Then the mission initiates an on-call phase, where the teams are on standby, and finally a launch phase, when Space Force gives the companies 24 hours to get the rocket and satellite off the ground.\nSpace Safari aims to build upon the success of its most recent responsive demo mission, which flew in June 2021, as well as use the TacRS program to leverage and test more companies.\nBirchenough said Space Safari sees this program as a \"crawl-walk-run approach,\" with initial planning for the next mission underway.\n\"We're pushing the limits here and taking some risks,\" she added.\nFirefly originally planned to fly a NASA mission on its third Alpha rocket launch, after the company\n. And then Space Safari came knocking, and Weber said his company had enough \"flexibility\" on the timing of the NASA mission to swap it out for Victus Nox.\nStanding at 95 feet tall, Firefly's Alpha rocket is designed to launch as much as 1,300 kilograms of payload to orbit — at a price of $15 million per launch. That puts Firefly in the medium-lift category of rockets, between small launchers such as\nElectron and the \"heavy\" rockets such as SpaceX's Falcon 9.\nFirefly completed a \"full-duration static fire\" of the Alpha rocket at Vandenberg, and the company is now going through final readiness steps. Victus Nox represents a distinct opportunity for Firefly, both to prove it's ready to fly national security missions as well to use the launch to streamline its processes and move faster.\n\"Firefly emerges from this mission set ready to go at a much quicker pace,\" Weber said. \"When Victus Nox launches, our intention is to go two months after that and on in succession. Alpha will be that predictable schedule, of a one metric ton rocket [flying] every two months.\"\nWeber said the company currently has customer commitments for seven more flights on Alpha after Victus Nox.\nAccording to Millennium CEO Jason Kim, the Space Safari team came to the company's production line and said, \"Hey, I want one of those spacecraft.\"\n\"The idea there is if you take something that's off the production line, you don't have to start from scratch to rapidly deploy a tactically responsive space capability to meet an urgent need or augment capabilities that are already on orbit,\" Kim said.\nKim said Millennium modified the Victus Nox satellite in eight months, a significantly shorter timeline than the typical 24- to 36-month process of starting an order from scratch.\nThe Boeing subsidiary is \"very focused\" on the national security side of the space market, Kim said, with Victus Nox coming as its latest project to deliver spacecraft \"affordably on rapid timelines.\"\nMillennium has heavily prioritized vertical integration, which Kim said helps the company \"control the cost, the schedule and the quality of those components\" in the spacecraft it builds.\n\"We're learning so much from [Victus Nox], and the Space Force is learning a lot from it,\" Kim said.\nOnce Space Force issues the call to launch, Kim said his team will work with Firefly to fuel and process the spacecraft and integrate it on the rocket. Once the spacecraft is in orbit, Millennium will check it within 48 hours to show it's working properly and ready for operations.\n\"It's this team, this collective team — the Space Force, Millennium Space Systems, Firefly — against the threats, we don't see it against each other,\" said Kim. \"We all have a common purpose. And I think that's gone a long way to the success that we're showing.\""},

In late March, before the UFC deal was announced, WWE CEO Nick Khan said the company keeps fans' price sensitivity in mind.\n\"If NBCU came to us and said, 'Hey, we'll take you from where you're at now to five times for Peacock, but we need to charge an upcharge,' we'd have to take a hard look at that,\" Khan told\n\" podcast. \"Most importantly, we don't want to price out our fans.\"\nJerry D'Erasmo, a longtime fan who\n, said he understands why WWE might eventually shift WrestleMania back to pay-per-view. Yet he also thinks it's one of the few things that could actually turn off swaths of the fan base. He said many fans have told him that they'll tune in to recap podcasts like his own instead of paying $60 or $70 to watch a pay-per-view.\nHow WWE will tell its stories and conduct its matches under a new executive regime will also help determine how they spend their money, fans said.\n\"The biggest concern from a fan's perspective — not from investors', but from fans' — is creative control,\" said Matt Courcelle, longtime wrestling aficionado and host of\n.\nIn this case, there's an elephant in the room, and its name is Vince McMahon. For many WWE fans, whether they'll pay up for new streaming or pay-per-view services rests a great deal on whether McMahon, 77, who's controlled WWE since taking over from his father in 1982, will be involved with creative decisions.\nDespite numerous settlements with women who have claimed sexual misconduct by McMahon, including a\n, which he denies, he remains at the top of WWE.\n\"This guy, for better or for worse, has been in control of the biggest wrestling company in the world,\" said Jimmy Baxter, a pro wrestling commentator and podcaster in New Jersey. \"For that, he was a success story, but along the way, there's a lot of blood, sweat and tears — and a lot of paid-off women.\"\nMcMahon isn't going anywhere, at least not any time soon. He will be the executive chairman of the new combined company, which has yet to be named, alongside\nChief Executive Ari Emanuel. After 40 years, many fans see him as a permanent fixture, even if he's not the CEO.\n\"When the bombs drop, there'll be three things left: cockroaches, Twinkies and Vince McMahon,\" Baxter said.\nMcMahon told CNBC last month he won't be deeply involved with WWE's storytelling when WWE and UFC merge — but fans say they need more proof before they'll accept his statements at face value.\n\"As much as they want to tell us he's not 'in the weeds' in creative, there's been a lot of evidence lately that Vince is,\" Courcelle said, including rumors he was\n.\nThere are other concerns about the content, too.\nIn late April, a former WWE writer\n, claiming she was fired in retaliation for pushing back against racist pitches in the writer's room, according to court documents.

Anyone who's forked over thousands of dollars on wrestling events and merchandise over the years won't immediately stop watching if the new WWE isn't up to snuff in their eyes. Some longtime hardcore fans aren't sure where they'll land quite yet, but they are likely to stick around to see where things go from here.\n\"I absolutely love the drama,\" Baxter said. \"I love watching a crazy old man burn his empire to the ground solely because he can.\""},

Last fall, the company released a more expensive Apple Watch, called Ultra.\nApple's China regional business, which includes the mainland, Taiwan and Hong Kong, reported $17.81 billion in sales, down from last year's $18.34 billion. Analysts had hoped that China's demand for electronics would rise in the quarter as the company exits out of Covid-era lockdowns and other restrictions.\nWhile sales shrunk in most regions that Apple monitors, they grew in the Asia Pacific region to $8.11 billion.\nCook was optimistic about Apple's prospects in India after his visit last month to the country where he opened Apple stores and met with politicians.\n\"The switcher and first-time buyer metrics look very good there for India,\" Cook said.

Apple said it paid $23 billion in buybacks and dividends in the March quarter. Apple also raised its dividend 4% to 24 cents per share.\nCook also said that Apple was not planning layoffs like those that other big tech companies have started over the past year.  \"I view that as a last resort and, so, mass layoffs is not something that we're talking about at this moment,\" he said."},

In its fiscal second quarter, Apple reported total revenue of $94.84 billion.\nGene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, told CNBC Thursday he estimates India accounts for just under 3% of Apple's total revenue.\nInvestors have been focused on Apple's potential in India after the tech giant recently ramped up its presence by opening its\n.\nIndia's smartphone market is dominated by low-cost Android phones, such as those offered by\nand Chinese players like Oppo and Xiaomi.

Richard Windsor, founder of independent research firm Radio Free Mobile, pointed toward a difference of gross domestic product per capita between the two nations, a metric often used as a broad measure of average living standards. China's GDP per capita is more than 5 times the size of India's, according to the World Bank.\n\"So while potentially lots of Indians would like to buy the iPhone, in terms of total numbers, in terms of the numbers that can actually afford it in India, it is probably going to be an awful lot less than China,\" Windsor said.\nApple's strategy in India is beyond just selling hardware, however. The company is also looking to India to become a key manufacturing hub as it looks to reduce its reliance on China.\nApple\nlast year — the first time that the company has produced its latest device in the country, so close to its initial launch.

He's made fast-food sandwiches. He's been a custodian and a junk-hauler. And he's done technical sound work for live theater.\nThese days, though, his work is less hands-on: He's an artificial intelligence trainer.\nSavreux is part of a hidden army of contract workers who have been doing the behind-the-scenes labor of teaching AI systems how to analyze data so they can generate the kinds of text and images that have wowed the people using newly popular products like ChatGPT. To improve the accuracy of AI, he has labeled photos and made predictions about what text the apps should generate next.\nThe pay: $15 an hour and up, with no benefits.\nOut of the limelight, Savreux and other contractors have spent countless hours in the past few years teaching OpenAI's systems to give better responses in ChatGPT. Their feedback fills an urgent and endless need for the company and its AI competitors: providing streams of sentences, labels and other information that serve as training data.\n\"We are grunt workers, but there would be no AI language systems without it,\" said Savreux, who's done work for tech startups including OpenAI, the San Francisco company that released ChatGPT in November and set off a wave of hype around generative AI.\n\"You can design all the neural networks you want, you can get all the researchers involved you want, but without labelers, you have no ChatGPT. You have nothing,\" Savreux said.\nIt's not a job that will give Savreux fame or riches, but it's an essential and often overlooked one in the field of AI, where the seeming magic of a new technological frontier can overshadow the labor of contract workers.\n\"A lot of the discourse around AI is very congratulatory,\" said Sonam Jindal, the program lead for AI, labor and the economy at the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit based in San Francisco that promotes research and education around artificial intelligence.\n\"But we're missing a big part of the story: that this is still hugely reliant on a large human workforce,\" she said.\nThe tech industry has for decades relied on the labor of thousands of lower-skilled, lower-paid workers to build its computer empires: from punch-card operators in the 1950s to more recent Google contractors who've complained about second-class status, including yellow badges that set them apart from full-time employees. Online gig work through sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk grew even more popular early in the pandemic.\nNow, the burgeoning AI industry is following a similar playbook.\nThe work is defined by its unsteady, on-demand nature, with people employed by written contracts either directly by a company or through a third-party vendor that specializes in temp work or outsourcing. Benefits such as health insurance are rare or nonexistent — which translates to lower costs for tech companies — and the work is usually anonymous, with all the credit going to tech startup executives and researchers.\nThe Partnership on AI warned in a 2021 report that a spike in demand was coming for what it called \"data enrichment work.\" It recommended that the industry commit to fair compensation and other improved practices, and last year it published voluntary guidelines for companies to follow.\nDeepMind, an AI subsidiary of Google, is so far the only tech company to publicly commit to those guidelines.\n\"A lot of people have recognized that this is important to do. The challenge now is to get companies to do it,\" Jindal said.\n\"This is a new job that's being created by AI,\" she added. \"We have the potential for this to be a high-quality job and for workers who are doing this work to be respected and valued for their contributions to enabling this advancement.\"\nA spike in demand has arrived, and some AI contract workers are asking for more. In Nairobi, Kenya, more than 150 people who've worked on AI for Facebook, TikTok and ChatGPT voted Monday to form a union, citing low pay and the mental toll of the work, Time magazine reported. Facebook and TikTok did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the vote. OpenAI declined to comment.\nSo far, AI contract work hasn't inspired a similar movement in the U.S. among the Americans quietly building AI systems word-by-word.\nSavreux, who works from home on a laptop, got into AI contracting after seeing an online job posting. He credits the AI gig work — along with a previous job at the sandwich chain Jimmy John's — with helping to pull him out of homelessness.\n\"People sometimes minimize these necessary, laborious jobs,\" he said. \"It's the necessary, entry-level area of machine learning.\" The $15 an hour is more than the minimum wage in Kansas City.\nJob postings for AI contractors refer to both the allure of working in a cutting-edge industry as well as the sometimes-grinding nature of the work. An advertisement from Invisible Technologies, a temp agency, for an \"Advanced AI Data Trainer\" notes that the job would be entry level with pay starting at $15 an hour, but also that it could be \"beneficial to humanity.\"\n\"Think of it like being a language arts teacher or a personal tutor for some of the world's most influential technology,\" the job posting says. It doesn't name Invisible's client, but it says the new hire would work \"within protocols developed by the world's leading AI researchers.\" Invisible did not immediately respond to a request for more information on its listings.\nThere's no definitive tally of how many contractors work for AI companies, but it's an increasingly common form of work around the world. Time magazine reported in January that OpenAI relied on low-wage Kenyan laborers to label text that included hate speech or sexually abusive language so that its apps could do better at recognizing toxic content on their own.\nOpenAI has hired about 1,000 remote contractors in places such as Eastern Europe and Latin America to label data or train company software on computer engineering tasks, the online news outlet Semafor reported in January.\nOpenAI is still a small company, with some 375 employees as of January, CEO Sam Altman said on Twitter, but that number doesn't include contractors and doesn't reflect the full scale of the operation or its ambitions. A spokesperson for OpenAI said no one was available to answer questions about its use of AI contractors.\nThe work of creating data to train AI models isn't always simple to do, and sometimes it's complex enough to attract would-be AI entrepreneurs.\nJatin Kumar, a 22-year-old in Austin, Texas, said he's been doing AI work on contract for a year since he graduated college with a degree in computer science, and he said it gives him a sneak peak into where generative AI technology is headed in the near-term.\n\"What it allows you to do is start thinking about ways to use this technology before it hits public markets,\" Kumar said. He's also working on his own tech startup, Bonsai, which is making software to help with hospital billing.\nA conversational trainer, Kumar said his main work has been generating prompts: participating in a back-and-forth conversation with chatbot technology that's part of the long process of training AI systems. The tasks have grown more complex with experience, he said, but they started off very simple.\n\"Every 45 or 30 minutes, you'd get a new task, generating new prompts,\" he said. The prompts might be as simple as, \"What is the capital of France?\" he said.\nKumar said he worked with about 100 other contractors on tasks to generate training data, correct answers and fine-tune the model by giving feedback on answers.\nHe said other workers handled \"flagged\" conversations: reading over examples submitted by ChatGPT users who, for one reason or another, reported the chatbot's answer back to the company for review. When a flagged conversation comes in, he said, it's sorted based on the type of error involved and then used in further training of the AI models.\n\"Initially, it started off as a way for me to help out at OpenAI and learn about existing technologies,\" Kumar said. \"But now, I can't see myself stepping away from this role.\""},

That's largely because the deposits come with government-backed insurance protections, which have a long history of safety.\nThey're also not designed to be big profit centers. Rather, by offering high yields for consumers who have long housed their money in stagnant accounts, tech and fintech companies are opening the door to potentially new customers.\nApple has a whole suite of financial products, including a credit card and payments app, that pair smoothly with the savings account, which is only available to the\n-plus Apple Card holders.

Aside from posting on TikTok, she uses Instagram, YouTube and Twitter, and she also runs a podcast and a weekly newsletter.\nTu said she began building out her presence on multiple platforms before a potential TikTok ban entered the equation, and she's hoping she spread out her income sources enough to be OK if anything happens. But she called her work on TikTok, where she has more than 2.4 million followers, her \"pride and joy.\"\n\"It would be a huge letdown to see the app get banned,\" she told CNBC in an interview.\nThe top social media companies in the U.S. are preparing to try to fill the vacuum.\n, which owns Instagram and Facebook, has been pumping money into its TikTok copycat, called Reels. CEO\nsaid on the company's\nlast month that users are resharing videos over 2 billion times a day, a number that's doubled in the past six months, adding \"we believe that we're gaining share in short-form video.\"\nand YouTube have been pouring billions of dollars into their own short-video features to compete with TikTok.\nTu said she expects there will be a \"massive exodus\" of creators that flock to other platforms if TikTok is banned, but that the app is hard to beat when it comes to discovering new and relevant content.\n\"That's why someone like myself, who didn't have a single follower, didn't have a single video, could make a video and have the very first one get 3 million views,\" she said. \"That really doesn't happen anywhere else.\"\nEmily Foster, a small business owner, agrees. She said other media platforms can't come close to offering the type of exposure she gets from TikTok.\nFoster designs stuffed animals that she sells through her\nshop and her website called Alpacasews. She said she started sewing the plushies by hand as gifts for her friends and on commission. But when a video of a dragon she made during the pandemic received 1,000 views on TikTok — a number that's tiny for her these days — she said it gave her the confidence to open an Etsy shop.\n\"I was like, 'Oh my god, this could be something,'\" she told CNBC.\nFoster's designs quickly gained traction on TikTok, where she now has more than 250,000 followers. She recently shared a behind-the-scenes video that showed her packaging up an order for someone who ordered one of every stuffed animal in her Etsy shop. The video quickly amassed more than 500,000 views, and her entire inventory sold out within a day.\nDemand for Foster's stuffies soon outpaced her ability to make them by hand, so she turned to crowdfunding site Kickstarter to raise money to cover manufacturing costs. She raised over $100,000 in her most recent\n, which came after three of her videos went viral on TikTok.\n\"My business would never be where it is today without TikTok,\" she said.\nWith the looming threat of a TikTok ban, Foster said she's been sharing content across Instagram, YouTube and Twitter to try to expand her following. At this point, she said, her business would probably survive if TikTok goes away, but it would be difficult.\n\"The audience just isn't there, especially for smaller creators,\" she said.\nBeyond the money, Foster is concerned about losing the following she's worked so hard to build. She said she's met \"fantastic\" friends, artists and other small business owners on the platform.\n\"You're never quite alone. It means a lot,\" she said. \"I'm stressed about potentially losing sales, potentially losing customers, but it's more so just losing a community that'll break my heart.\"\nFor Spangler, the artist, the debate surrounding TikTok is maddening not just because of what it could mean for his livelihood, but because it seems to him that lawmakers are ill-informed about what the app does.\nSpangler recalled one Republican congressman asking Chew in his testimony about whether TikTok connects to a user's home Wi-Fi network.\n\"If you even have a working knowledge of anything technology related, if you watched those hearings, it was just very embarrassing,\" Spangler said. \"What's extra frustrating is it feels like this is being potentially taken away from me by people who have no idea how any of this works.\"\nSpangler channeled his anger into his artwork. After the hearing, he designed a T-shirt featuring a zombie-like congressman with the phrase, \"Does the TikTak use a Wi-Fi?\"\nHe shared a video about it on TikTok and made almost $2,500 from T-shirt sales in less than two days."},

Measures included allowing firms to issue dual-class shares — which are attractive to founders as they grant them more control over their business — on the main market.\nLast week, the Financial Conduct Authority also\nas one single category for shares in commercial companies.\nThis would remove eligibility requirements that can deter early-stage firms, allow for more dual-class share structures, and remove mandatory shareholder votes on acquisitions, the regulator said.\nDespite the negative implications of Arm's decision, investors largely remain upbeat about London's prospects as a global tech hub.\n\"Fortunately for us, it doesn't mean that the UK is not attractive to investors,\" Nelis told CNBC. \"It just means that where you IPO is just a financing event.

And quite frankly, people weren't looking at it from a use-case perspective, they were just looking at it [and asking] how can I make the most money?\"\nOne of the biggest emerging topics for this corner of the market is the ability to \"tokenize\" real world assets like gold on a blockchain.

In 2015 and 2016 almost every bank in the U.S. went through a test-and-learn phase with blockchain technology – private blockchains, not public ones like the Bitcoin network.

OCBC, for its part, announced in 2022 plans to hire 1,500 tech employees over the next three years.\nAnd STLogistics announced last year it would invest 1.7 million Singapore dollars ($1.2 million) to encourage employees to pick up digital skills like software robotics.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.; Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio; Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; Ed Markey, D-Mass.; Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\nThe letter references details from discrimination lawsuits against Tesla, in which Black workers said they regularly faced racist discrimination at work, and women who worked at Tesla reported blatant objectification and harassment by male co-workers, with little to no support from management. The EEOC, a federal agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws against workplace discrimination, has\na\nagainst Tesla, the company disclosed in June last year.\nThe senators wrote workers at Tesla's Fremont, California factory seem to have brought at least five times as many discrimination lawsuits last year than workers at comparable plants run by other companies.\n\"Only a few of these cases, however, have managed to survive in court, with most being forced out of court following Tesla's motions to compel arbitration,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"The details these cases allege —some of which we noted above — raise significant concerns about not only Tesla management's complicity and participation in the discriminatory conditions, but also the untold number of other complaints that remain confidential.\"\nForced arbitration clauses in consumer contracts have similarly obscured important details about Tesla's vehicle safety and business practices from the public, the lawmakers wrote.\n\"The public deserves the full record of safety complaints about Tesla vehicles,\" they said, adding that while clauses in customer contracts can theoretically let customers opt out of forced arbitration, they rarely do so, making the difference basically moot.\nOf particular concern to the senators were consumer complaints of phantom braking that occurred in Tesla vehicles.\n\"Beyond flawed design choices, Tesla's vehicles appear to be plagued by myriad hardware and software issues: steering wheels in two Tesla vehicles fell off during operation because of a missing retaining bolt, which NHTSA recently opened an investigation into, while another vehicle appeared to spontaneously combust,\" they wrote. \"But because Tesla drivers, as a practical reality, are subject to confidential arbitration agreements, we and the public – including would-be buyers – have no visibility into what complaints may have already been made and what other potential safety issues with Tesla vehicles may exist.\"\nBeyond asking Tesla to commit to ending arbitration clauses in employee and consumer contracts and to stop filing motions to compel arbitration in court, lawmakers asked Tesla for detailed information on its arbitration practices.\nFor example, the senators asked how many racial harassment, discrimination and retaliation complaints Tesla received from workers since 2012 and how many were settled or went to arbitration. They asked for the same details about sexual harassment complaints from Tesla workers.\nThe senators also asked for more information on when Tesla added the ability for consumers to opt out of forced arbitration and how many had actually been able to do so historically.\nThe senators sought detailed information on the types of vehicle-related complaints they received from customers, which hardware and software factored into those complaints, how many were settled prior to arbitration and how many that went to arbitration were found in favor of the consumer.\nMandatory arbitration is a common practice among new- and used-car dealerships, says Paul Bland, executive director at Public Justice, the consumer advocacy group. However, Tesla makes and sells its cars directly to consumers, so its forced arbitration clauses cover more than the norm where auto sales are concerned.\nBland said, \"It makes a lot of sense to me that senators would focus on this. Tesla uses arbitration clauses as a tactic to shunt people into a forum that's pretty rigged for the corporation.\"\nThe long-time consumer advocate views arbitration as a secretive system that makes it harder for consumers to find out what happened to people in previous related cases. Bland also said arbitration makes it harder for consumers to form class action lawsuits or even to make informed choices about where they want to take their business."},

They are instead flocking to Bluesky, a buzzy invite-only app that may be the alternative jaded Twitter users have been looking for.\nBluesky is in beta testing, meaning it's not widely available yet;\nit has about 50,000 users. The invitation system has reduced the risk of bad actors by limiting sign-ups and prioritizing people who bring in \"\n.\" Some members of\nmarginalized communities who are on it say they are cautiously\noptimistic that their early input will help create a tolerant environment as the app grows.\nBlack tech workers on Twitter were one of the first communities to migrate to Bluesky, an initiative spearheaded by an active user named Aveta.\n\"I just felt sad that many of my favorite people on Twitter were leaving and I didn't get to interact with them and it just felt like a shell,\" said Aveta, who asked to use her screen name to protect her privacy. \"So I was, like, maybe by bringing them over to Bluesky, I can see them again.\"\nAveta joined the platform on April 15. She said she was encouraged by how familiar it felt and the team's support for community builders. She secured some invitation codes and set out to bring in as many people as possible. Her first objective was to get her community, Black tech Twitter, onto Bluesky.\n\"One thing that has remained consistent throughout all those years of social media was, at the core of the social media, Black people made it popular,\" she said. She added: \"We have such a huge impact on these networks, yet we are so often overlooked.\"\nOnce Black Twitter users started moving to Bluesky, Aveta said, others wanted to follow.\n\"Black Twitter\" — an unofficial group of users self-organized around shared cultural experiences that convenes sometimes viral discussions of social issues to pop culture — has played a key role in movements such as\nand\n.\nIn 2018, Black Americans accounted for an estimated\n, roughly double the proportion of the U.S. Black population, according to the media measurement company Nielsen. As of last spring, Black Americans were 5% more likely than the general population to have used Twitter in the last 30 days — second only to Asian American users, it said.\nSome signs indicate a slowdown among Black Twitter users that predates Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter last year. In April 2022, the rate of growth among Black Twitter users was already slower than among any other ethnic group: 0.8% in 2021, down from 2.5% the previous year, according to estimates provided by Insider Intelligence eMarketer.\nAveta said she prioritized moving the Black tech community to Bluesky first to combine social appeal with technical knowledge.\n\"I really wanted us in because, alongside the dev team, we can help shape and mold it. We can help give a perspective that may have not been considered before,\" she said.\nThe research firm Data.ai said that despite its invitation-only mode, Bluesky has ranked highly in download charts around the globe.\nAveta has instructed those who want her Bluesky invitations to have someone who can vouch for their characters, because she has built her Bluesky community with intention.\n\"The internet has good people, but it has very, very nasty people, and for me, when I'm inviting people and when I'm in that community-building mode, I will do everything in my power to make sure I keep them out,\" she said.\nAveta has dubbed herself the \"unofficial sky mama\" because of the number of invitations she has doled out to new users. She estimates that she has given out nearly 1,000, but she has lost track of the exact number. After she brought her community in, Aveta extended her invitations to people of color, queer people and disabled people.\n\"Intersectionality matters to me,\" she said.\nAmong those she invited were several members of Tech by Choice, a 1,200-member nonprofit group that helps marginalized communities enter and stay in the tech industry. Valerie Phoenix, 29, who founded and runs the organization, said: \"Through her, I was able to get people from the Tech by Choice community onto the platform so that they can understand what's going on and learn how to build for the platform, which I think is huge — to have developers of color that are underrepresented trying to build for a new platform.\"\nPhoenix, who goes by @DigitalBlkHippy on Twitter, said that Twitter has become more of an obligatory part of her social media presence — announcements and professional interactions, for example — since Musk took over and that she finds herself engaging more with community on Bluesky. The hands-on moderation on Bluesky makes her feel safe, she said, and she's encouraged by the feedback the Bluesky team solicits.\n\"It seems to be the opposite direction when it comes to moderation on Twitter,\" she said.\nQueer and trans users have also taken to Bluesky, quickly becoming a\nof it. Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School Cyberlaw Clinic and a trans rights activist, said one of the best parts about Bluesky, compared to Twitter, is that she can post normally without immediately getting an influx of transphobic remarks or death threats.\n\"It was really nice to post stuff in a place that was so queer- and trans-friendly,\" Caraballo said. \"Also, it was very sex worker-positive, and it just overall had very good vibes. It was just refreshing, and it reminded me what social media actually could be.\"\nCaraballo said Bluesky's unique corporate structure as a public benefit limited liability company may have an impact on the app's culture moving forward. A public benefit LLC allows executives to pursue social causes without prioritizing shareholder returns.\n\"What that does is allow a company to have more leeway to protect its users without necessarily having to have a business rationale behind its policies,\" she said.\nPariss Chandler, the organizer of Black Tech Twitter and the founder of the recruitment platform Black Tech Pipeline, said diversity, equity and inclusion should be considered early in a platform's launch. The prominence of marginalized communities in Bluesky's beta testing is valuable for the developers who are building the app, she said.\n\"They are really lucky to have all of these different communities on there, especially marginalized communities, because they're getting feedback immediately,\" Chandler said. \"It's like you're getting different feedback from different experiences, different wants and needs and features people would like to see on the platform and why those things are important, especially when it comes to safety and moderation.\"\nChandler said the developers' quick responses to feedback or issues are a \"beta experience,\" because the platform isn't widely available. However, once Bluesky becomes accessible to everyone, she said, moderation will be harder to address.\nCaraballo agreed that scaling up Bluesky's moderation will be a challenge but said the actions of its current user base may dictate user expectations moving forward.\n\"The most effective moderation is going to be community and social norms, like what is and isn't OK to do,\" she said. \"And by establishing early that harassment and anti-social behavior is not really going to be tolerated, it can really kind of build up a specific type of community.\"\nJasmine Enberg, a principal analyst at eMarketer Insider Intelligence, said the challenge will be to maintain the same sense of comfort for users as Bluesky scales up.\nAlthough the app has many similarities to Twitter, its key difference is that it is decentralized. That means user data can be stored on independent servers rather than on one owned by the company. In the future, users will be able to develop their own servers to use with communities of their choosing.\nFor now, most users interact on one main feed. As the servers splinter, it could result in communities that have more autonomy to punt trolls — or a more complicated, and less attractive, interface for potential new users.\n\"It's easier right now because it's smaller, right?\" she said. \"But overall, it is the closest thing we have to a near-perfect replica of Twitter and, right now, without many of the challenges.\"\nBluesky didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In its\non its website, it says that as it grows, it will use \"automated filtering, manual admin actions and community labeling\" to moderate content."},

Thomas said the market is young and evolving.\n\"People are just now starting to secure the cloud,\" he said. \"We win some, we lose some.\"\nRappaport called out Palo Alto Networks, which has an offering called Prisma Cloud, as his company's best place to snag business.\n\"Probably the product that we are replacing the most is Prisma Cloud,\" Rappaport said, adding that it's not a pricing battle because Wiz is \"usually priced higher than any other product.\"\nMuch of Palo Alto's expansion into the cloud has come via acquisition, with CEO Nikesh Arora allocating over $3 billion in recent years to purchases to build his company's presence in the space. Rappaport said that while he respects the strategy, the result has been a \"Frankenstein mashup.\"\n\"They're still figuring out how to make it one single platform,\" Rappaport said.\nAnkur Shah, a senior vice president at Palo Alto Networks, defended his company's technology and said Wiz isn't the right choice for clients that want to protect their assets.\n\"Wiz is all about visibility,\" Shah said. \"Visibility is good. Security is better.\"\nWiz's spokesperson disputed that notion, and said the company's technology \"helps organizations detect, prioritize, prevent and remediate issues.\"\nWhile Wiz is gaining traction against the industry stalwarts, it still has a long way to go. A KeyBanc first-quarter survey of technology resellers and channel partners showed that 28% of respondents viewed Palo Alto Networks as the best positioned cloud security vendor, while 24% picked Microsoft and 4% chose Wiz.\nOne big way Wiz has garnered name recognition so quickly is by discovering potential problems involving mass-market software. In March, Wiz disclosed a vulnerability in Microsoft's Azure Active Directory sign-on service that would have enabled attackers to change the results people see in Microsoft's Bing search engine. Microsoft fixed the issue and said that \"no unintended access had occurred.\"\nWiz has also\nmultiple\nin Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure, a product the company knows well because many of its customers use it. Rappaport also knows plenty about Microsoft, having sold his prior security startup,\n, to the company for $320 million in 2015.\nThe advantage Microsoft has, Rappaport says, is expertise in quickly assessing the risk of a threat and bringing in the right teams to deal with them.\n\"They have the most scars on their hand,\" he said.\nfor our weekly, original newsletter that goes beyond the annual Disruptor 50 list, offering a closer look at list-making companies and their innovative founders."},

It revealed a quantum leap in the ability of humans to seamlessly interact with AI, which in turn can access the entire information universe of the internet.\nAI is having its iPhone moment. Apple's breakthrough product sparked the invention of a new ecosystem of apps bringing users new services, ranging from Uber to Instagram, because suddenly they had a computer in their pocket. Coinciding with that mobile revolution was a computing one as well, with exponential power to shift data into the cloud.\nNow we're seeing a similar technological boom around AI. It's not just about the startling experience of interacting with the latest chatbots. AI will influence, disrupt and accelerate every industry. In fact, it's already happening.\nWith OpenAI topping\n, there's no question that the dominant theme not just for the annual ranking but for the venture-backed tech startup space as a whole is artificial intelligence.\nAnd it's not just companies that have AI at their core. We're seeing a range of enterprise applications for AI to drive efficiency and new capabilities across companies and sectors of the market. Of the 50 companies on this year's list, 21 told us that AI is critically important to more than 50% of their revenue.\nHalf of the companies in the top 10 of the 2023 CNBC Disruptor 50 list feature key use of AI, and notably, they represent a diverse range of industries and use cases.\n, the No. 3 company, is integrating ChatGPT into its design tools, giving customers a new way to be creative. No. 4 Disruptor\nis using AI to make 3D-printed rockets. No. 7 Disruptor\ndeploys AI to identify and attack security threats. U.K.-based renewable energy company\n, No. 8 on this year's list, uses AI to efficiently match energy supply and demand. No. 9\nuses AI to optimize the movement of goods across the temperature-controlled supply chain.\n\"I do think we are deep into a new technological wave and this is, I think, the biggest one in a while,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in an interview with CNBC late last week.\nNo. 19 on the Disruptor 50 list,\n, has worked with companies including OpenAI to label the massive amounts of data — images, text, voice and video — that the machines need to digest to become better learners. Also on the list is the No. 44 Disruptor,\n, which was founded by former Google Brain researchers who helped develop a new method of natural language processing — transformers — that enable systems to grasp a word's context more accurately.\nAltman said OpenAI is seeing artificial intelligence affect nearly every industry. He pointed to the legal profession as a prime example.\n\"What we're hearing from customers using our API for legal companies is that it is totally transforming the way they work and the efficiency that any one lawyer can achieve and the accuracy, freeing people up to do more of what they do really well, and having this new tool to sort of give them as much leverage as possible,\" Altman said.\n\"That is a pattern we're seeing again and again in many industries, and I'm super excited about it,\" he said.\nIts ability to make stock market investors skittish became clear when\n's shares tanked after the rollout —\n— of its\nearlier this year. And in one of the sectors seen as being most acutely at risk from generative AI, education,\njust because its CEO referenced an impact from ChatGPT on customer growth during its recent earnings call.\nFor now, OpenAI has a dual revenue stream: an enterprise software model where it charges companies for access to the platform, and a premium chat app it offers to consumers for $20 monthly, in addition to the free version.\n\"For now, we're pretty happy with these two models. We're super open to explain other things,\" Altman said, \"you know, when we're very much at the very start of this technology.\"\nOpenAI's business customers include\n,\n, and its backer Microsoft, which is\nto its Bing and Edge internet browsers and Microsoft 365 suite of business software, including Word, PowerPoint and Excel.\nhas reportedly swelled to $13 billion, and the startup's valuation is reported to be as high as $29 billion. The company declined to provide any funding or valuation data.\nThe growth in the power of AI has been so rapid and dramatic it has sparked concern\n. Those looking to play in the space — including Elon Musk, who was an early co-founder of OpenAI and now says he\n— are also speaking out about the risks. Musk, along with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and a range of professors and CEOs,\nin March from the Future of Life Institute, urging AI labs to stop training models that are more powerful than OpenAI's GPT-4.\nin an appearance at a virtual event at MIT, saying that consistent safety guidelines were needed but that this proposed pause was \"missing most technical nuance about where we need the pause.\"\nAltman continues to advocate for regulation. \"We really need regulation here. We've been calling for it since the start of the company,\" he said. \"I think we're going to get some regulation, and we'll get more over time. And I think that's really critically important. So I'm happy that it's happening.\"\n\"I think to get to the future where we have as much of the good use of AI and minimize the what could be quite bad uses of AI,\" Altman said, \"there's just no way around having regulation here. We have regulation for other industries with much less powerful technology. So we should definitely have it here.\"\nReid Hoffman, partner at venture capital firm Greylock, was an early investor in OpenAI and is now an investor in a number of AI companies and the co-founder of AI startup Inflection. He said he finds some of the criticism to be more dangerous than OpenAI.\n\"A bunch of it is well-intentioned; there are a bunch of different ways AI can play out,\" said Hoffman, who is also on the Microsoft board of directors and had served on the OpenAI board before\n\"Some of it is less well intentioned: 'Everyone else, slow down so I can speed up.' And this is one of those things where it is overall a mistaken effort. ... The call to slow down is, in fact, less safe than what they're proposing,\" he said, referring to OpenAI and Altman.\nIn addition to concerns about AI being used to manipulate or mislead, Altman said he is working to tamp down on bias within OpenAI's systems.\n\"A big part of that is what we call RLHF, or reinforcement learning from human feedback, where we take these models that are pretrained on a significant fraction of the internet and we can sort of push them in certain ways,\" Altman said. \"We can teach the models like, 'Hey, there's a bias here in the data. You shouldn't act this way.'\" He said that from GPT-3 to GPT-4 the company has been able to make great strides in reducing bias in the model.\nAs companies including OpenAI battle bias and push for smart regulation, they're also working with the established tech behemoths, such as Microsoft, and leaders in all sorts of industries to help them evolve, so they're not disrupted."},

Monarch Tractor, which recently debuted another key electric vehicle born in the state of California — a driver-optional, all-electric tractor — valued by investors in the private market at $271 million.\nBut its CEO Praveen Penmetsa says there are several reasons to believe it's the next big thing in agtech, and its home base is the perfect place for agriculture and tech to finally come together in a business model that solves some of farming's biggest challenges.\n\"We are turning Livermore into the center of agtech for the world over,\" Penmetsa told CNBC's Julia Boorstin from a local vineyard near its headquarters in California after it was named to the\nlist on Tuesday,\n.\nThe startup recently signed a deal with\n, making the liquor giant the first company to put its MK-V tractors, which rolled off the production line in December, out in the fields.\nFarmers are struggling with high labor costs and their diesel engine carbon footprint, while corporations are facing new sustainability costs. These are problems that Monarch Tractor can solve in combination.\n\"It's more efficient on the labor side but decreases the emissions and can power all the other equipment on the farm,\" Penmetsa said.\nWhen the company's co-founders — including a former Tesla gigafactory chief — launched the company in 2018, the goal, Penmetsa said, was to build a tractor every farmer in world can eventually afford to use. Its chief farming officer, Carlo Mondavi, is a fourth generation member of the famous vineyard family.\nThe company and its tractors are not there yet on the cost curve. EV tractors remain expensive — around $90,000 in the case of Monarch's first line — but incentives in California and the cost of diesel have brought the payback period for buyers down to as little as two years in the state, he said.\nPenmetsa says it will also pay off for companies like Constellation Brands, which face mounting requirements to report on ESG goals and generate cost savings from more efficient operations, while also winning the brand war with consumers of the end product.\nNone of that would be happening as easily if the company didn't have Silicon Valley roots. The cameras on the tractors and AI technology — aided by an NVIDIA computing platform — can identify what is happening on the tractor and out into the surrounding acreage, and that allows Monarch to train the tractor \"very quickly,\" Penmetsa said, and then go out to new farms and new crops.\n\"Farms and farmland are close by, but we are also very close to Silicon Valley, where AI technologies are developed. Autonomy was developed here,\" said Penmetsa, who is an autonomy and mobility engineer. \"Electric equipment and cars were developed here. So that makes this the logical location for us to develop these technologies and deploy them.\""},

This is our historical responsibility,\" Zelenskyy said in a speech.\n\"Only one institution is capable of responding to the original crime, the crime of aggression: a tribunal. Not some compromise that will allow politicians to say that the case is allegedly done, but a true, really true, full-fledged tribunal.\"\nAn act of aggression is defined by the United Nations as the \"invasion or attack by the armed forces of a state (on) the territory of another state, or any military occupation\".\nThe ICC, which is based in The Hague and which Zelenskyy visited earlier in the day, issued an arrest warrant for Putin for suspected deportation of children from Ukraine.\nBut it does not have jurisdiction over alleged crimes of aggression, and the European Commission, among others, has already brought its support for the creation of a separate international centre for the prosecution of the crime of aggression in Ukraine, that would be set up in The Hague.\n\"We all want to see a different Vladimir here in The Hague, the one who deserves to be sanctioned for his criminal actions here, in the capital of international law,\" Zelenskyy said, referring to Putin.\n\"I'm sure we will see that happen when we win, and we will win,\" he said, adding: \"Whoever brings war must receive judgement.\"\nMajor legal and practical questions remain around how such a court would be legitimized, either by a group of countries supporting it or with approval from the U.N. General Assembly.\nRussia is not a member of the ICC and already rejects its jurisdiction. It denies committing atrocities during its conflict with Ukraine, which it terms a \"special operation\" to \"demilitarize\" its neighbor.\nRussia claimed that the U.S. helped Ukraine plot and carry out an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin, which it labelled as an assassination attempt on the Russian president, claiming \"Washington is definitely behind this attack.\"\nKremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday that Russia believed Ukraine was implementing plans \"dictated\" by Washington, but did not provide any evidence to support the allegations.\n\"Attempts to disown this, both in Kyiv and in Washington, are, of course, absolutely ridiculous. We know very well that decisions about such actions, about such terrorist attacks, are made not in Kyiv but in Washington,\" Peskov said, according to comments reported by Reuters.\n\"This is also often dictated from across the ocean. We know this well and are aware of this ... In Washington they must clearly understand that we know this.\"\nUkraine has denied involvement in the incident, which took place in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\nPeskov added that the purported drone attack requires a \"thorough, urgent investigation\" and that Russia's response would involve \"well thought-out, balanced steps.\"\nRussia could respond in a variety of ways, Peskov said, without providing further details. On Wednesday, the Kremlin said \"the Russian side reserves the right to take retaliatory measures where and when it sees fit.\"\nA political adviser to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that Russia staged a drone attack on the Kremlin that Moscow blamed on Kyiv.\nUkraine has already vehemently denied any involvement in the incident, which Russia characterized as a \"planned terrorist attack\" and assassination attempt on Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nMykhailo Podolyak, a top Ukrainian official, voiced further doubts over the purported \"attack\" on Twitter Thursday, stating that video footage of the \"attack\" — which showed two unidentified figures on the roof of the Kremlin's Senate building as a drone explodes above it — was suspicious, as was the 12-hour delay between the alleged incident and the Kremlin's announcement on it.\nPodolyak said that, in contrast, the shelling of the city of Kherson in southern Ukraine on Wednesday that left 23 civilians dead was all too real.\nOleksandr Prokudin, the head of the Kherson regional military administration, said Thursday morning that Russia shelled the wider region 98 times over the previous 24 hours, and that residential areas of the region were targeted. Russia denies targeting civilians, despite daily strikes on civilian infrastructure.\nRussia's ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, said Wednesday that Russia will respond to an alleged drone attack on the Kremlin \"when we consider it necessary.\"\nThe Kremlin blamed the \"attack\" on Ukraine yesterday, calling it an assassination attempt on Russian President Putin, but did not present evidence to back up its allegations. Kyiv denied any involvement in the incident.\n\"How would Americans react if a drone hit the White House, the Capitol or the Pentagon? The answer is obvious for any politician as well as for an average citizen: the punishment will be harsh and inevitable,\" Antonov said,\n.\n\"Russia will respond to this insolent and presumptuous terrorist attack. We will answer when we consider it necessary. We will answer in accordance with the assessments of the threat that Kiev posed to the leadership of our country.\"\nUkraine denied any involvement in an alleged drone attack which the Kremlin alleges Kyiv carried out in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\nSome Western analysts believe it's likely that Russia staged the \"attack\" itself as a possible \"false flag\" attack, and to bolster its portrayal of Ukraine as a \"terrorist\" state. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Russia's report should be taken with a \"very large shaker of salt.\"\nAntonov hit back at those responses, saying U.S. officials had been \"striking in their cynicism and absurdity.\"\n\"The theses that this act of terrorism was allegedly a 'false flag operation' are blasphemous and deceitful. That is, it was Russia itself that staged a provocation against the heart of our statehood?!,\" Antonov said.\nThe ambassador did not detail how Russia might \"respond\" to the incident but claimed it showed Ukraine did not want peace.\n\"Our adversaries have no desire to seek peace, to save thousands of lives of ordinary Ukrainians. Definitely, we will take this circumstance into account while working out our strategy to implement the goals and objectives of the special military operation,\" Antonov said.\nUkraine's capital Kyiv and the port city of Odesa were targeted in further attempted drone strikes overnight, Ukrainian officials said.\nSerhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration, said on Telegram that the capital had been targeted again with drones and missiles, marking the \"third attack on the capital over four days of May.\"\n\"Our city has not suffered such a dense intensity of strikes since the beginning of this year,\" Popko said. The air raid alert in Kyiv lasted over three hours last night. Popko said the drones and missiles were destroyed, although the debris from destroyed drones damaged some buildings and parked cars. No casualties were reported, he said.\nSeparately, Ukraine's southern command grouping said 12 out of 15 drones used to attack Odesa overnight were destroyed.\nUkraine's air force said it destroyed 18 out of 24 Iranian-made \"Shahed-136/131 combat drones\" that were launched overnight by Russia from its Western Bryansk region, and from the eastern coast of the Sea of Azov. The drones were shot down in the northern, central, and southern regions of Ukraine, it said.\nCNBC was unable to immediately verify the details within the reports.\nRussia accused Ukraine of attempting to attack the Kremlin Wednesday, saying the government in Kyiv tried to strike the presidential residence in Moscow using two unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones.\nUkraine denied any involvement in the incident, saying it more likely signaled that Russia was planning a large-scale terrorist attack against Ukraine in the coming days. Russia has often been accused of plotting \"false flag\" attacks that it can blame on Ukraine and use to justify or escalate its own military aggression against the country.\nAnalysts at the Institute for the Study of War said Wednesday evening that \"Russia likely staged this attack in an attempt to bring the war home to a Russian domestic audience and set conditions for a wider societal mobilization.\"\nSeveral indicators suggest that the strike was internally conducted and purposefully staged, the ISW noted, not least of all because Russia has recently taken steps to increase its domestic air defense capabilities and it was extremely unlikely \"that two drones could have penetrated multiple layers of air defense and detonated or been shot down just over the heart of the Kremlin in a way that provided spectacular imagery caught nicely on camera.\"\nIn addition, the ISW said it believes that the Kremlin's \"immediate, coherent, and coordinated response\" to the incident suggests that the attack \"was internally prepared in such a way that its intended political effects outweigh its embarrassment.\"\nThe Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin was not injured in what it characterized as \"a planned terrorist attack\" and assassination attempt (Putin had not been in the Kremlin at the time of the alleged incident). It did not provide any evidence that Ukraine had carried out the attack.\nPresident Joe Biden said his administration would continue to support newsrooms and journalists around the world in a statement on World Press Freedom Day.\n\"No journalist – American or not – should have to risk their lives and livelihoods in pursuit of that truth. Evan Gershkovich and Austin Tice weigh heavy on my mind today,\" Biden said.\n\"A free press is a pillar of democracy. It allows our government and our society to be self-critical and self-correcting. It educates, illuminates, exposes, and uncovers.

And what happened in Moscow was obviously an escalation of the situation in light of May 9,\" alluding to Russia's upcoming Victory Day parade commemorating the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.\nThe comments come after the Kremlin claimed Wednesday that Ukraine tried to strike the Kremlin with drones overnight, but said the purported attack on the heart of the Russian government was \"successfully repulsed.\"\nRussian President Vladimir Putin was not injured in the incident,\n. It provided no evidence to back up the claim of an attempted attack.\nThe Kremlin claimed Wednesday that Ukraine tried to strike the Kremlin with drones overnight but said the attack on the heart of the Russian government was \"successfully repulsed.\"\nRussian President Vladimir Putin was not injured in the purported attack,\n, which provided no evidence to back up the claim of an attempted attack, however.\n\"Last night, the Kyiv regime attempted to strike the Kremlin residence of the President of the Russian Federation with unmanned aerial vehicles,\" the Kremlin stated, with the claim detailing that \"two unmanned aerial vehicles were aimed at the Kremlin.\"\n\"As a result of timely actions taken by the military and special services with the use of radar warfare systems, the devices were disabled,\" the Kremlin said.\n\"As a result of their fall and the scattering of fragments on the territory of the Kremlin, there are no casualties and material damage.\"\nPutin was not injured and continues to work as usual after the Kyiv attack, it said.\nThe Kremlin's statement suggested that it viewed the attempted attack as a \"planned terrorist action\" and an attempt on the life of the president ahead of Victory Day on May 9.\nRussia was already believed to be slimming down its Victory Day parade, which commemorates the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in WW2, amid fears of Ukrainian strikes.\nRussia reserves the right to respond to an attempt to strike at the Kremlin where and when it sees fit, the Kremlin added, without giving details on how it planned to respond.\nFootage began circulating on social media channels purportedly showing what could be an unmanned aerial vehicle appearing to explode above a domed roof of one of the Kremlin's buildings.

That's what it is from beginning to end, it's a manufactured crisis driven by MAGA Republicans in the Congress.\"\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics' jobs report on Friday found nonfarm\nfor the month, far beating Wall Street estimates of 180,000. The growth puts the unemployment rate at 3.4%, compared to an estimate of 3.6%, tying it for the lowest level since 1969.\nBiden praised the figures but warned if Republicans did not agree to lift the debt ceiling and prevent a default, the impact on the economy could be catastrophic. The president cited a recent Moody's report which showed 780,000 people could lose their jobs if the country were to default on its debt.\nLifting the debt ceiling is necessary for the government to cover existing spending commitments already approved by Congress and the president. Doing so does not authorize new spending, but House Republicans have said they will not authorize a lift if future spending cuts are not agreed to. The White House has said it is open to discuss spending cuts but will not negotiate with Republicans on the debt ceiling, and lifting it is their constitutional responsibility.\n\"They're two separate issues – two,\" Biden said. \"Let's get it straight: They're trying to hold the debt hostage for us to agree to some draconian cuts, magnificently difficult and damaging cuts. But unfortunately, they're threatening to undo all this progress by letting us default.\"\nCongress lifted the debt ceiling three times under the Trump administration without conditions. Biden warned of the impact it could have on the country's standing in the world, saying America is \"not a deadbeat nation\" and that the standoff \"is becoming an issue in other countries\" who worry the U.S. will default.\nBiden will meet with the four top congressional party leaders at the White House next week and try to reach a deal. The president last met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in\n. The president said he hopes Republicans will agree to have \"normal arguments\" instead of ultimatums when they meet.\n\"Next week I'm going to reiterate to congressional leaders that they should do what every other Congress has done — that is, pass the debt limit, avoid default,\" Biden said. \"I've said all along: We can debate where to cut, how much to spend, how to finally overhaul the tax system to where everybody has to pay their fair share or continue the route their on, but not under the threat of default.\""},

We have repulsed international terrorism, we will protect the inhabitants of Donbas, we will ensure our security,\" Putin said, according to comments translated by Reuters.\nPutin and other heads of state from former Soviet states, as well as top military personnel and war veterans, are attending the event today.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen arrived in Kyiv on Tuesday for talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after a new wave of Russian air strikes on the capital.\nThe trip falls on the European Union's Europe Day, which Ukraine adopted as its own on Monday, underlining its ambition to join Western institutions after applying to join the EU last year following Russia's invasion.\n\"Good to be back in Kyiv. \"Where the values we hold dear are defended everyday,\" von der Leyen said on Twitter alongside a photograph of her arriving by train.\nShe began her highly symbolic trip shortly before Russian President Vladimir Putin marked the Soviet victory in World War Two with an annual military parade and speech on Moscow's Red Square.\nZelenskyy acted on Sunday to institute May 8 as the day Kyiv commemorates the World War Two victory -- meaning it will no longer mark it on the same day as Moscow, Ukraine's former Soviet master.\n\"I welcome President Zelenskyy's decision to make 9 May Europe Day also here in Ukraine,\" von der Leyen tweeted.\nEurope Day honours a 1950 French declaration that led to the founding of the body that became the EU.\nThe European Commission, the EU executive, took the unusual step of publicly announcing her trip the day before she travelled. Visiting dignitaries usually keep wartime trips Ukraine secret for security reasons.\nUkraine's capital Kyiv was targeted by another Russian missile strike on Monday. The head of the city's military administration noted that it's the fifth time the capital has been attacked since the start of May.\nSerhiy Popko, head of Kyiv City Military Administration,\nthat it was no accident that the latest attack came on the eve of Moscow's annual Victory Day parade, saying Russia was using its \"sacred date\" to then \"try to kill as many civilians as possible on this day.\"\nMonday night's attack was carried out by four Tu-95MS strategic bombers from the Caspian Sea region, Popko said, but he noted that the cruise missiles launched by the fighter jets had not reached their targets.\n\"The anti-aircraft defense of the capital worked perfectly again! According to preliminary information, about one and a half dozen enemy air targets were detected and destroyed in the airspace around Kyiv,\" Popko said. No one was injured in the attack, preliminary information suggested, he said.\n\"Kyiv stood up again and will stand up in the future,\" Popko said.\nKyiv's Mayor\nthat during the attack on Kyiv, \"a fragment of a downed rocket fell on a private yard in Holosiivskyi district of the capital. The burning wreckage was extinguished. There were no casualties or damage.\" Explosives experts, rescuers and police are still working on the scene, he said Tuesday morning.\nCNBC was unable to immediately verify the information in the posts but, in recent days, Kyiv has been targeted in several attacks after a relative lull in several months. Early Monday morning, Kyiv was struck by Iranian-made \"Shahed\" drones.\nUkrainian Air Defense forces destroyed 35 \"Shahed\" drones used in strikes on the capital, the forces' General Staff said, but debris from the interceptions damaged buildings and cars and injured at least five people, according to local authorities.\nDespite being one of the most important dates in Russia's calendar, Victory Day in Russia has not been what it was for a number of years now.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic and now the ongoing war with Ukraine have sorely affected annual commemorations of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.\nThis year, Russia's growing domestic insecurities as a result of the war — and an uptick on attacks on its own soil — is also marring the commemorative event, with at least six regions (including Crimea) and 21 cities canceling their Victory Day parades, Britain's Ministry of Defense noted last Friday.\nMoscow's Victory Day celebration is likely to be held on a much smaller scale this year and Russian President Vladimir Putin's reception following the parade will not go ahead. The reception was last held in 2019, the U.K. noted.\nThe traditional \"March of the Immortal Regiment,\" in which family members display photographs of dead veterans of World War II, has also been canceled. That follows the recent cancellation of the Russian-hosted International Army Games, the U.K. noted.\nThe timing of a recent alleged drone strike on the Kremlin a few days before Victory Day showed, the ministry said, \"Russia's increasing vulnerability to such attacks and has almost certainly raised the threat perception of the Russian leadership over the Victory Day events.\"\n\"The potential for protests and discontent over the Ukraine war are also likely to have influenced the calculus of the Russian leadership.\"\nThe Kremlin said all possible security measures were in place ahead of this year's Victory Day and that Putin will watch the parade on Red Square along with the leaders of other former Soviet republics that now form part of a bloc known as the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nThe heads of state will then lay flowers and have an informal breakfast together, Peskov said. The parade is due to start at 10a.m. Moscow time. Putin is due to give a speech at the event and is also expected to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\nRussia could intensify its military aggression against Ukraine today, given the backdrop of Victory Day and an uptick in attacks on the country in recent weeks ahead of Kyiv's expected counteroffensive.\nThe Kremlin has already been using security concerns as a justification for its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, with Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov claiming that \"the nature of the Kyiv regime requires that Moscow be vigilant and reaffirms that President Putin made the right decision to start the special military operation,\" Tass reported.\nPeskov repeated baseless claims that Russia was still dealing the \"manifestations of Nazism in one way or another.\"\nAs it looked to bolster public support for its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has repeatedly stated that the government in Ukraine is a Nazi regime, despite the fact that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish.\nUkraine and its Western allies have repeatedly rejected Russia's claims as nonsensical and part of a wider, deeper campaign to spread misinformation about the invasion and its motives for launching it.\nAll eyes are on Russia's Victory Day parade today that marks the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.\nMoscow usually uses the large-scale parade in Moscow to show off its military hardware as Russian President Vladimir Putin and his military generals, as well as other guest heads of state, look on.\nThis year will be different, however, with the ongoing war in Ukraine involving much of Russia's military personnel and hardware. Security concerns are high on the Kremlin's watchlist this year, particularly following a recent alleged drone attack on the Kremlin.\nSix regions, including Crimea, and 21 cities across Russia have canceled their May 9 parades in light of security concerns, Britain's Ministry of Defense said Monday.\nKremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said stringent security measures were in place ahead of Victory Day.\n\"All the necessary measures are being taken to ensure security, especially when foreign guests, our head of state will be in attendance. Everything that is required by law is being done to that end,\" he told Russia's Channel One television network on Monday,\nWagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin ditched his threat from last week to leave the war-ravaged city of Bakhmut in light of insufficient ammunition supplies.\nThe private military firm's boss wrote on Telegram Sunday,: \"Overnight we received a combat order, for the first time in all this time. We have been promised as much ammunition and weapons as we need to continue further operations. We have been promised that everything needed to prevent the enemy from cutting us off will be deployed on the flank.\"\nPrigozhin on Friday released a video in which he, surrounded by dead bodies of Wagner fighters, blasted Russian Defense Ministry chiefs for failing to supply his combatants with the ammunition they needed to fight in Bakhmut, an eastern Ukrainian city that's been the site of the war's longest and bloodiest battle so far.\nCivilians and city officials took stock of damage from the wreckage of Russian drones shot down over Kyiv early Monday morning.\nUkrainian Air Defense forces destroyed all 35 Iranian \"Shahed\" drones used in Russia's strikes on the capital, the forces' General Staff said, but debris from the interceptions damaged buildings and cars and injured at least five people, according to local authorities.\nMoscow is going ahead with Victory Day celebrations on Tuesday, which include a major military parade, to celebrate the anniversary of the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.\nThis year's commemoration follows a turbulent week that saw an alleged attempted drone attack on the Kremlin, which Moscow blames on Ukraine and Washington, but that Kyiv argues was staged by Russia to escalate the war.\nA Moscow city official was\nas describing \"a nervousness that I have never seen before\" in the wake of the drone attack, but then adding that the Victory Day parade must still take place.\nAt least six regions in Russia have canceled their Victory Day celebrations.\nThe Guardian writes, \"Tellingly, on Friday, Putin took the unusual step to discuss the preparations for the 9 May Victory Day parade in a meeting with his security council, composed of Russia's top state officials and heads of defence and security agencies ... Even before the drone attack on the Kremlin, there were signs of unease among the Russian leadership over the celebrations amid fears of Ukrainian strikes.\""},

Biden met with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., along with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\nSpeaking after the meeting, Biden told reporters the leaders' staffs agreed to continue meeting beginning Tuesday night and daily through Friday.\n\"Everyone in the meeting understood the risk of default,\" Biden said. \"I made clear during our meeting that default is not an option.\"\nMcCarthy told reporters he did not see \"any new movement\" in negotiating positions over the debt limit during the meeting.\n\"Everybody in this meeting reiterated the positions they were at,\" before the meeting, McCarthy said outside the White House.\n\"I asked [Biden] numerous times if there were places we could find savings,\" in the federal budget, said McCarthy. \"He wouldn't give me any.\"\nEvery leader present except for McCarthy agreed to remove the threat of default when asked by Biden, according to Democratic leaders at the meeting.\n\"We explicitly asked Speaker McCarthy, 'Would he take default off the table?' He refused,\" said Schumer. \"Instead of him giving us a plan to remove default he gave us a plan to take default hostage. And that is a shame, because it makes things more complicated.\"\nBiden said \"I don't know\" what McCarthy thinks.\n\"I think he knows better,\" the president said. \"I think he knows that default would be disastrous and I think he knows what he's passed could not possibly pass anywhere in the Congress — it's dead on arrival.\"\nAsked about the mood in the room, Biden said three of the four leaders were sensible throughout the discussions.\n\"The tenor of the meeting was with three of the four participants very measured and low key. Occasionally there would be a little bit of an assertion that maybe was a little over the top from the speaker,\" Biden said.\nSchumer called on McCarthy to negotiate proposed spending cuts\nthrough the usual budgetary process without threatening default.\n\"There are large differences between the parties. If you look at what President Biden had proposed and you look at what Speaker McCarthy has proposed, they're very, very different,\" Schumer said. \"We can try to come together on those in a budget and appropriations process but to use the risk of default, with all the dangers that has to the American people, as a hostage and say it's my way or no way, or mostly my way or no way, is dangerous.\"\nMcConnell joined McCarthy outside the White House, where he reiterated that Congress would not allow the country to default on its debt.\n\"The United States has never defaulted on its debt and it never will,\" said McConnell. Still, \"there must be an agreement ... and the sooner the president and the speaker can reach an agreement the sooner we can solve the problem.\"\nJeffries, speaking to reporters after the meeting, framed House Republicans as the only group that would not rule out the prospect of a first-ever default on U.S. debt.\n\"House Democrats have taken default off the table; Senate Democrats have taken default off the table; Senate Republicans, as just indicated by Leader McConnell, have taken default off the table; President Biden from the very beginning took default off the table,\" Jeffries said. \"There's one group in Washington, D.C., extreme MAGA Republicans, who have indicated they are willing to take us down a path of default. That is reckless, irresponsible and extreme.\"\nLifting the debt ceiling is necessary for the government to cover spending commitments already approved by Congress and the president and prevent default. Doing so does not authorize new spending. But House Republicans have said they will not lift the limit if Biden and lawmakers do not agree to future spending cuts.\nThe White House has stressed that while it is open to discuss spending cuts, it will not negotiate with Republicans on the debt ceiling. The Biden administration has said the GOP has a constitutional responsibility to raise the borrowing limit.\n\"Those two are totally unrelated. Whether you pay the debt or not, doesn't have a damn thing to do with what your budget is,\" Biden said Friday. \"They're two separate issues — two. Let's get it straight.\"\nThe Treasury Department has started to take extraordinary steps to keep paying the government's bills, and expects to be able to avoid a first-ever default at least until early June. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\nthat failure to hike the debt ceiling would cause an \"economic catastrophe.\"\nDefaulting on sovereign debt would wreak havoc on the economy and roil markets around the world. A Moody's report last year said a default on Treasury bonds could throw the U.S. economy into a tailspin as bad as the Great Recession.\nIf the U.S. were to default, gross domestic product would drop 4% and 6 million workers would lose their jobs, Moody's projected. Even a brief default would lead to the loss of 2 million jobs, according to the data.\nIn that scenario, U.S. bond ratings would be classified as \"restricted default,\" according to Fitch Ratings, and Treasurys would have a D rating until the U.S. could once again borrow. The Brookings Institution noted a default could lead to $750 billion in higher federal borrowing costs over the next decade — a twist given that Republican concerns about spending and debt have helped to fuel the borrowing-limit stalemate.\nWhat's more, a default would shake the U.S. position on the world stage. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the Senate Intelligence Committee last week that\nof the U.S. potentially defaulting on its debt. Haines warned the two nations would attempt to highlight \"the chaos within the United States, that we're not capable of functioning as a democracy.\"\nWith tight margins in both chambers of Congress, gridlock is nothing new. But when it comes to default ultimatums, the president has pleaded with lawmakers to engage in\ninstead.\n\"As I've said all along, we can debate where to cut, how much to spend, how to finally overhaul the tax system to where everybody has to pay their fair share or continue the route their on, but not under the threat of default,\" Biden said on Friday. \"Let's remove the threat of default. Let's have normal arguments. That's why we have a budget process to debate in the open so you all can see it.\"\nSchumer on Tuesday said it wasn't a fair negotiating tactic and not one Democrats used when former President Donald Trump was in office.\n\"When President Trump was president, I was Democratic Minority Leader,\" Schumer said. \"I could have said I'm holding [the debt ceiling] hostage unless we repeal the Trump tax cuts, your signature issue. But McCarthy is saying I'm holding it hostage unless you repeal the IRA, which was our signature issue.\"\nBiden said he trusted McCarthy would do what he promised, but added that the speaker is in a tough position.\n\"I trust Kevin will try to do what he says,\" Biden said. \"I don't know how much leeway Kevin McCarthy thinks he has in light of the fact, and I'm not being a wise guy when I say this, it took 15 votes for him to acquire the speakership and apparently he had to make some serious concessions to get it from the most extreme elements of his party. So I — I just don't know.\"\nBut congressional Republicans are united in their refusal to vote to raise the limit without concessions. They view Tuesday's meeting as a long-awaited face-to-face negotiation with the president.\nIf the meeting is indeed a negotiation, then the bill House Republicans passed last month effectively serves as the GOP's opening offer to the White House.\nDubbed the Limit, Save and Grow Act,\nwould impose sweeping cuts to federal discretionary spending, impose new work requirements for welfare recipients and expand mining and fossil fuels production, all in exchange for raising the debt limit for about a year.\nBut rather than provide a jumping off point for talks, the GOP bill has so far served only as a political cudgel, energizing Democrats' opposition to Republican demands.\nIn the Senate, Schumer has attacked the bill on a near-daily basis ever since it was introduced.\nThe White House also has pointed to some of the the bill's most conservative proposals and cuts as evidence that Republicans are willing to let the nation default in order to slash spending from key programs."},

Prior to 1917, Congress needed to approve additional debt for each new spending measure it passed. Until recently, it has been a rather routine process. Congress has lifted the debt limit 78 times since 1960. The debt ceiling was last raised in December 2021 by $2.5 trillion, capping the limit at $31.381 trillion.\nIf Congress does not agree to lift the debt ceiling, the government will not have money to pay its bills and will default on its debt.

The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates in the first half of June, $50 billion in Social Security benefits are set to be dispersed, $20 billion in Medicaid provider payments, $12 billion in veterans' benefits, $6 billion in federal salaries and $1 billion in SNAP benefits.\nIn an interview Monday with CNBC, Yellen demurred when asked how payments would be prioritized.\n\"There are no good options; every option is a bad option,\" Yellen said. \"I really don't want to get into discussing them and ranking them because as every Treasury secretary has known, the only option that really leaves our economy and our financial system in good shape is raising the debt ceiling and making clear that Congress stands behind the basic principle that America pays its bills.\"\nRepublicans are concerned about the increasing national debt, which has grown from less than $1 trillion in the 1980s to more than $3 trillion today. They are refusing to lift the debt ceiling unless it is paired with spending cuts.\nHouse Republicans passed the Limit, Save and Grow Act last month outlining the areas they want to pare back.

But one of the lasting changes to dining behavior has been the increasing popularity of reservations, particularly those made online.\nWhen cities and states rolled back lockdown rules, many implemented new orders for restaurants to help with contact tracing, such as requiring customers to book tables in advance. Even after vaccination requirements disappeared, higher demand for reservations has stuck around.\nOpenTable reservation service said in 2022 that it connected more than 1 billion people with restaurants every year. That number has climbed to more than 1.5 billion consumers, as of Monday.\n\"We definitely see that the demand and love of restaurants has been unleashed,\" said Hannah Kelly, chief marketing officer of Resy, OpenTable's main rival.\nAs a result of those pandemic-fueled changes, restaurants and the companies that help them book their tables are targeting big spenders with premium reservation options to drive higher sales. The strategy echoes the broader push across industries to encourage customers to pay more for better experiences, such as they can get by buying airlines' first-class tickets, Tide's laundry detergent pods and\n's AirPods Pro.\n\"It's not just about getting bodies in the door anymore,\" SevenRooms co-founder and Chief Product Officer Allison Page told CNBC. \"It's making sure the restaurant is getting the right body in the doors, whether that's customers that visit frequently or have a higher average spend per cover.\"\nWith backing from Danny Meyer's\n, SevenRooms offers restaurants tools such as online ordering, waitlists and reservations — and then it shares more customer data with them than Resy and OpenTable do to help them target specific diners.\nAbout two-thirds of SevenRooms' restaurant clients use its software to promote special experiences or sell upgrades when customers book reservations. Page said the move toward premium restaurant reservations can partially explain why it feels like it's so much more competitive to book a table in advance these days.\n\"A lot of those reservations are being saved for top customers,\" she said.\nFor example, booking a table at celebrity favorite Carbone in Las Vegas will be nearly impossible for the average diner. But MGM Rewards members who have at least gold status will see more desirable reservations available, thanks to SevenRooms.\nSimilarly, Resy's Global Dining Access program offers exclusive reservations at some of the most in-demand restaurants, such as Balthazar and Le Bernardin in New York City. The booking company launched the program in 2021, two years after\nbought Resy to add more benefits for its cardholders. The exclusive reservations are only for customers with select AmEx cards, including the company's platinum option, which carries a hefty $695 annual fee.\nResy's Kelly said the program now has more than 650 restaurants, primarily in the biggest U.S. cities.\nKirk Estopinal, a partner at New Orleans restaurant Cane & Table, said he initially had hesitations about setting aside tables solely for American Express cardholders.\n\"I kind of don't like the whole '\nline' of restaurant reservations,\" he said. \"I had some concerns about it, just having people basically pay for access to what should be a democratized situation in my mind.\"\nBut about nine months ago, Cane & Table took the plunge and joined the program. Estopinal said setting aside a few tables for those reservations has given the restaurant some extra wiggle room for walk-ins or allowed diners to linger\nif the seats weren't booked ahead of time.\n\"The whole point is to catch a fish in the end, right? Whether that fish is a walk-in or from the Global Dining Access program,\" he said.\nEstopinal said he hasn't seen any metrics that show that Global Dining Access members spend more money than the typical diner, adding that many of Cane & Table's customers are on vacation and are already willing to spend more on their food and drinks.\nBut reserving tables just for big spenders and loyalty program members isn't the only way that restaurants are looking to bookings for extra revenue.\nSevenRooms' Page said the company helps restaurants brainstorm different ideas for charging reservation fees. But the key is to make sure that extra money comes with a better experience for the customer. For example, a rooftop bar could charge a fee for bookings made at sunset or the Bellagio Resort in Las Vegas could charge for a table that faces its famous fountains.\nTailor has required customers to make reservations and prepay for their meals when they book tables ever since it opened, in December 2018. The Nashville restaurant pitches itself as a \"unique dining experience\" with two seatings every night. Reservations on Thursday and Sunday cost $100 per person, while weekend bookings run $125 per head. Tailor also charges a service fee to replace the tipping model.\nVivek Surti, the chef and restaurateur behind the supper club, said the business model makes operating a restaurant much easier. Knowing how many customers will show up every night results in less variability in his cost of goods and cuts down on food waste, helping his overall profit margins.\nSince the pandemic, customers have been more willing to prepay for their meals, even as the restaurant's prices have doubled compared with pre-Covid, Surti said.\n\"We want to make sure that we provide a great experience, that we're buying the best possible product that we can, that we're giving our employees a very good livable wage and salary,\" he said."},

The drawn-out feud spilled into the courts after the district's new board of supervisors, which had been hand-picked by DeSantis, voted to nullify development deals that Disney struck shortly before they replaced the old board.\nThe governor's board members claimed the deals were unlawfully passed and undercut their power over the 25,000-acre area. But Disney says the contracts were crafted to help lock in its long-term development plans amid escalating tension with DeSantis and his allies.\nOn Friday, the final day of the state's 2023 legislative session, DeSantis\nthat included language effectively targeting Disney's development contracts. It precludes an independent special district \"from complying with the terms of any development agreement\" that is struck within three months before a law \"modifying the manner of selecting members\" of that special district's governing body.\nRepublican state Sen.

Not for two or three years, but for 20, 40, 50 [years].\"\nIt's just the second company currently listed with LTSE. Reinhart says he first read about the market a few years ago and started talks to list on the exchange over the past two years.\nLTSE was founded by tech entrepreneur Eric Ries in 2016,\nbut it took several years to get up and running. For a company to list with LTSE, it has to outline a set of principles to ensure that it will abide by certain long-term commitments, such as environmental improvements or corporate-governance standards.\nIn ThredUp's LTSE listing, for instance, the company calls \"the environment\" one of its \"most important stakeholders.\"\nLTSE launched in a bid to address\nthat companies have been maximizing profits for shareholders above all else.\nThe new stock exchange wants to \"reverse the epidemic of short-term thinking,\" Ries told CNBC. \"The incentives that we've created around finance, around the capital market, really make it difficult for companies to do the right thing.\"\nRies joins others, including billionaire investor\n, who have argued that such short-term thinking is hurting companies.\n\"People are going to realize that the definition of profit that we have been using the last 25 years is wrong, and that what it means to make a profit is to maximize human flourishing,\" Ries said.\nFor all its lofty ambitions, the path was never going to be easy for an exchange like LTSE — and it certainly hasn't been so far. There are more than a dozen stock exchanges in the U.S., but the majority of all trading occurs on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market, making it difficult for alternatives to gain traction.\nLTSE first gained approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2019, and it started trading in September 2020. The market struggled to pick up steam, but it saw a distinct boost in 2021 when software company\nlisted with it.\nLTSE functions similarly to other exchanges, with the same ticker symbol across all trading platforms. A company's opening and closing price will be established the same way it has been since going public, typically giving weight to the primary exchange it's on.\nLike any public company, those that list on the LTSE still report quarterly earnings, but the exchange's standards are designed so that the earnings reports are meant to give context to the long-term narrative of the listed company.\nA company that's dual listed on LTSE might list concurrently with an initial public offering or, like ThredUp, might be a public company that's traded elsewhere initially and chooses to meet LTSE's standards for listing. ThredUp first went public in March 2021 and is currently listed with Nasdaq.\nIts LTSE announcement arrives at a tricky time, though, given an increasingly difficult retail environment. For\n, the company reported a loss of $92.3 million, or 92 cents per share.\nBut Reinhart noted those industry challenges speak to ThredUp's commitment to long-term, forward-looking policies. \"It's always been easier to do these things later,\" he said. \"Sometimes companies need to lead and show people it can be done.\"\n\"It would have been really easy [for Reinhart] to call it off or to postpone because it's a tough time,\" Ries added, saying the dual listing lays a foundation \"for future prosperity at a time when the natural human impulse is to be afraid.\"\nOne other company, the communication platform\n, did list on LTSE but it delisted in 2022,\nconcerns.\nFor its part, LTSE said it will continue to eye the long game from here.\n\"We're not in a rush to make predictions about how [LTSE] is going to take over the world overnight, because ultimately, we only want the very best companies,\" Ries said. \"For us, this is about creating a real club of the best of the best to show that there's a new way forward.\""},

Wheels Up once promised to become the\nor\nof private jets. Dichter, who founded Marquis Jets in 2001 and later sold it to NetJets, launched Wheels Up in 2013 aiming to \"democratize\" private jets and make them more affordable and easier to book.\nThe company's flashy marketing campaigns, featuring sports celebrities such as Tom Brady and Serena Williams as brand ambassadors and investors, as well as lavish events, helped the company grow membership quickly.\nBut its stock price, which traded over $10 a share after it\n, is now trading at about 40 cents after a 20% decline Tuesday. Its valuation, once over $2 billion, has dwindled to about $100 million.\nLike many private jet startups, Wheels Up was dogged by high costs and operating issues.\nThe company reported losses of $555 million last year, even as revenue and memberships increased. The company said it hoped to be profitable in 2024, but in its\nreleased Tuesday, Wheels Up reported a loss of $101 million, about $12 million wider than its reported loss a year ago.\nWheels Up has been consulting with bankruptcy advisors and attorneys about possible capital raises or a restructuring, people familiar with the company's dealings told CNBC.\nWheels Up said in its earnings release Tuesday it is changing its pricing plan and product offering to better serve customers and become more efficient. For instance, it's moving away from less profitable markets in the West to focus more on the Northeast and other more active routes.\nA traditional individual Wheels Up membership has an initiation fee of $17,500 and annual dues of $8,500, with passengers paying additional hourly costs depending on the type of aircraft.\nIndustry experts say turning around Wheels Up will be difficult.\n\"It's the right move, they had to get out of unprofitable flights\" said the Doug Gollan, founder and editor of Private Jet Card Comparisons. \"But it's going to be a big challenge.\"\nThere may also be questions about Dichter's generous pay package. According to\n, Dichter will receive his base salary of $79,167 a month, or $950,000 a year, for two years. He will also receive $3 million as a lump sum \"in lieu of a bonus\" in addition to flight hours on Wheels Up planes.\nIn the event of a bankruptcy, Wheels Up's members may wonder what happens to their jet cards. Members and customers have purchased about $1 billion in flight hours on cards, some of which have not been used. Industry experts say it's unclear how or whether those members would be paid back in any bankruptcy, but they would likely become junior creditors.\nWarren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway owns competitor NetJets, said this weekend Wheels Up \"has 12,600 people who have given them over a billion dollars on prepaid cards … and I think there's a good chance some people are going to be disappointed later on.\""},

Immediately,\nSince then, several notable films and shows have halted or wrapped production early, including\n\"Stranger Things,\"\nand Marvel's \"Blade,\"\n\"Severance\" and\n\"Evil.\"\nBeyond the delayed production and likely delayed releases of these titles, industry experts worry the work pause could have a financial toll greater than that of the previous writers' strike.\nWriters who manned the picket lines 15 years ago remained on strike for 100 days, leading to an estimated cost of $2 billion to the industry, according to data from the Milken Institute. It also had major economic repercussions for ancillary businesses such as hotels, restaurants and construction companies that often work with film and television productions.\nThis is the first strike of its kind during the streaming era and hits many companies across three different facets of their media businesses: theatrical, linear TV and streaming.\nThe WGA is seeking higher compensation and residuals, particularly when it comes to streaming shows, as well as new rules that will require studios to staff television shows with a certain number of writers for a specific period. The WGA is also seeking compensation throughout the process of preproduction, production and postproduction. Currently, writers are often expected to provide revisions or craft new material without being paid.\nSeveral productions with finished scripts, such as\n\"The Rings of Power,\" have decided to continue filming without writers or showrunners on set. Others have opted to postpone production.\nOn Monday, Apple's drama series \"Severance\" paused production of its second season after members of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) and Teamsters refused to cross the WGA picket line at York Studios in New York.\nThis is the second Apple TV+ series to shut down because of the strike, after Maya Rudolph's series \"Loot\" paused filming last week in Los Angeles.\nOver the weekend, \"Stranger Things\" creators Matt and Ross Duffer announced production on the fifth and final season of the show had been delayed because of the labor unrest.\n\"Writing does not stop when filming begins,\" the duo tweeted. \"While we're excited to start production with our amazing cast and crew, it is not possible during this strike. We hope a fair deal is reached soon so we can all get back to work.\"\nParamount's \"Evil\" wrapped filming on season four earlier than anticipated, in part because of disruptions from picketing WGA members and, in part, because one of its cast members is taking a leave of absence due to a family matter. The season was slated to have 10 episodes, but it remains unclear whether the early end to production will affect those plans.\nstreaming show \"Hacks,\" Showtime's \"Billions\" and Starz's \"The Venery of Samantha Bird\" all stopped production.\nOn the theatrical front, Marvel has shut down production on its vampire thriller \"Blade.\" The film was set to begin shooting next month in Atlanta, Georgia. Nic Pizzolatto, creator of \"True Detective,\" was recently tapped to work on the script, but did not finish. Production is expected to restart once the strike is over.\nThe Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, in a response to a request for comment on the halted production, declined to comment beyond statements issued last week with the organization's stance on outstanding points of negotiation.\nThe strike is already having ripple effects across the industry as stars and talent stand in solidarity with writers.\nDrew Barrymore stepped away from her role as host of the MTV Movie Awards in support for the WGA. Several presenters, including Jamie Lee Curtis, also indicated that they would not attend the ceremony. The show ultimately canceled its live broadcast and aired a taped version of the event Sunday night.\nAt-home viewers may not notice the strike's effect right away, as episodes of popular shows continue to be released. However, future seasons could experience significant delays or a shortened number of episodes.\nThe writers for ABC's \"Abbott Elementary\" were supposed to convene on May 2 to begin work on season three of the popular comedy show. However, that room is closed for the strike.\nSimilarly, the writers room for Showtime's \"Yellowjackets\" only met for one day to work on season three before breaking for the strike. At Warner Bros. Discovery, the \"Game of Thrones\" prequel, \"A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight,\" also closed its writers room for the duration of the strike.\nNetflix's \"Big Mouth\" was six weeks into writing its eighth and final season, but paused due to the labor dispute. The streamer's hit \"Cobra Kai\" also saw its season six writers room shutter.\nThe longer the strike continues, the more productions are expected to be affected.\n\"A protracted strike is a definite possibility,\" wrote Doug Creutz, analyst at TD Cowen, in a research note published Friday. He defined protracted as more than three months.\n\"Clearly, a significantly extended strike would impact the amount of new shows available to streaming services and linear networks, which eventually could start to drive up both SVOD churn and linear cord-cutting,\" he said."},

They then benefited from huge consumer spending fueled by stimulus payments.\nThe pendulum swung last spring, however. Target,\n,\nand others suddenly had a glut of extra inventory — including a lot of popular pandemic categories like patio furniture and athleisure that had fallen out of favor. The excess supply ushered in a wave of deep discounts.\nNow, retailers are dealing with another dynamic. Consumers are\nthinking twice about discretionary spending as they rack up bigger bills at the grocery store or book trips instead of filling up their closets.\nSimeon Siegel, a retail analyst for BMO Capital Markets, said the pandemic gave retailers a chance to press the reset button. Their resolve, however, has faded.\n\"Very few companies have the fortitude to forgo volume for the sake of profits outside of a global pandemic,\" he said. \"It's very easy to fall back to the promotional drug when push comes to shove.\"\nAs higher transportation and supply chain costs roll off, he expects many retailers won't see the benefit because they are \"returning to the promotions cookie jar.\"\nThe company's results reflect company-specific challenges along with consumer trends.
