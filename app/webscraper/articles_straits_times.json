But Gerald Lim Lee Meng shared it with Yap Tin Foo, who was then the managing director of Starburst Engineering, which specialises in the design of firearms-training facilities.\nLim, 56, who has since resigned from CPG Consultants, on Tuesday pleaded guilty to an offence under the Official Secrets Act. Yap, who is 58, is no longer with Starburst Engineering and was charged with graft in August 2022. His case is pending.\nThe project involved the Home Team Tactical Centre (HTTC), a joint training facility for the police and SCDF. Phase 1 of the project was completed in July 2015. For Phase 2A, which cost $236 million, CPG was awarded the building consultancy contract on Aug 4, 2016.\nOut of 10 companies which tendered to be CPG’s main contractor, eight listed Starburst as their range specialist sub-contractor. One of them, China Construction, was selected as the main contractor in 2019.\nThe prosecution told the court that for the HTTC Phase 2A project, the Development Planning Committee (DPC) members who approved its funding were the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Finance. DPC figures in the documents entrusted to CPG were restricted information and were not to be revealed to any of the contractors, including Starburst.\nOn July 30, 2019, Lim passed Yap a hard copy of the documents during a meeting between CPG’s project team and Starburst.\nLim’s offence came to light when the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau started its probe against Yap. Hard copies of several restricted documents were found in Yap’s possession during a search of Starburst’s office on Nov 12, 2020. The documents contained a comparative analysis of the bids received for the HTTC Phase 2A project.\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Tan Hsiao Tien had urged the court to sentence Lim to the maximum fine of $2,000, arguing that the DPC information contained approved funding figures which could have guided the recipient’s company in its pricing strategy for future government contracts.\nShe added: “The documents also contained comparative analysis of main contractors’ bids, and their quoted prices for various components. This was confidential price information which could have prejudiced a contractor’s interest, had the information been obtained by a competitor.”\nFor breaking the law under the Official Secrets Act, an offender can be jailed for up to two years and fined up to $2,000"},

The person was not identified in court documents.\nThe person sent him the photos, which were taken with a mobile phone, via WhatsApp.\nPeh’s trial charge took place across three days in April and May 2021. In the course of his defence, he printed the photos and tendered them as defence exhibits. On the back of each photo, he wrote “CCTV from Tampine one [sic] Command Centre” and added the date and time.\nPeh claimed a security officer from the mall’s management provided the photos to him.\nHe added that the photos were screenshots obtained from the mall’s closed-circuit television cameras on the day and at the scene of the alleged offence. The photos were subsequently admitted as evidence.\nDPP Phang said, in reality, Peh knew that the evidence he gave was false but made these claims to exculpate himself in relation to the charge.\nAt the close of trial, Peh was convicted and fined $3,600.\nIn June 2021, a National Environment Agency inspector made a police report, stating that he had reason to believe Peh had given false evidence in court.\nSeeking at least two months’ imprisonment, DPP Phang noted that where the false evidence in question is both material and causes significant mischief, courts have imposed sentences longer than six months.\nHe said: “In the present case, the false evidence in question is material, since it related directly to the elements of the charge, and as such a sentence of at least several months’ imprisonment is warranted.”\nBut DPP Phang noted that the false evidence did not ultimately affect the outcome of the criminal matter, as Peh was convicted.\nDefence lawyer Daniel Xu sought six weeks’ jail for his client, adding: “He did not really mislead the court as the court did not believe him in the end. And he was given an appropriate fine at that juncture.”\nThose who intentionally give false evidence in court, or fabricate false evidence for it to be used in court, may be jailed for up to seven years and may be liable to a fine"},

Getting an unexpected alert could mean someone is trying to steal their account.\nAnother feature, device verification, checks that messages sent through WhatsApp match the device it is linked with, preventing hackers from impersonating victims on a separate device. The tool works in the background, needing no action from users, and has been rolled out to Android users first.\nUsers can also automatically verify that the person they are chatting with is really who they believe it is by clicking on the encryption tab under a contact’s information. Currently, users have to manually verify a security code.\nWhatsApp, which has some two billion users worldwide, said in a blog post on its website: “Protecting your personal messages with default end-to-end encryption is the foundation of that security and we will keep building new features to give you extra layers of privacy.”\nConcerns about WhatsApp security surfaced in November after reports claiming that a database containing the details of some 500 million users had been leaked and put up for sale. Meta has refuted these claims.\nThe latest security updates can make it tougher for impersonators to take over victims’ accounts even if their details have been leaked, said Ms Joanne Wong, vice-president of international markets at cyber-security firm LogRhythm. The changes also give business users some peace of mind as the app is widely used for work in the region.\nUnlike Telegram and many popular messaging apps,\nmaking it harder for chat details to be leaked. But Ms Wong noted WhatsApp still does not provide users the option to mask their contact number, which could be used by scammers.\n“The changes are not revolutionary, but it helps the app be more secure than before,” said Ms Wong.\nThe update will make it safer for users to transfer WhatsApp to other devices, and can help protect users who may unknowingly have downloaded viruses that can allow hackers to hijack their devices, said Privacy Ninja co-founder Andy Prakash.\nDevice verification technology, which stores an authentication token on the users’ device, is also not found in most other messaging apps, he noted.\nThe app’s encryption capabilities are also made more transparent, thanks to the option for users to verify if the messages with their friends are secure by checking the encryption tab, he said"},

{"url": "http://www.straitstimes.com/tech/tech-news/jailbreaking-ai-chatbots-is-tech-s-new-pastime", "title": "Jailbreaking AI chatbots is tech’s new pastime", "date": "2023-04-08T22:41:01+08:00", "content": "You can ask ChatGPT, the popular chatbot from OpenAI, any question. But it would not always give you an answer.\nAsk for instructions on how to pick a lock, for instance, and it will decline.\n“As an AI language model, I cannot provide instructions on how to pick a lock as it is illegal and can be used for unlawful purposes,” ChatGPT recently said.\nThis refusal to engage in certain topics is the kind of thing Mr Alex Albert, a 22-year-old computer science student at the University of Washington, sees as a puzzle he can solve. Albert has become a prolific creator of the intricately phrased AI prompts known as “jailbreaks.”\nIt is a way around the litany of restrictions artificial intelligence programs have built in, stopping them from being used in harmful ways, abetting crimes or espousing hate speech. Jailbreak prompts have the ability to push powerful chatbots such as ChatGPT to sidestep the human-built guardrails governing what the bots can and cannot say.\n“When you get the prompt answered by the model that otherwise wouldn’t be, it’s kind of like a video game – like you just unlocked that next level,” Mr Albert said.\nMr Albert created the website Jailbreak Chat early in 2023, where he corrals prompts for artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT that he has seen on Reddit and other online forums, and posts prompts he has come up with, too.\nVisitors to the site can add their own jailbreaks, try ones that others have submitted, and vote prompts up or down based on how well they work. Mr Albert also started sending out a newsletter, The Prompt Report, in February, which he said has several thousand followers so far.\nMr Albert is among a small but growing number of people who are coming up with methods to poke and prod – and expose potential security holes – in popular AI tools. The community includes swathes of anonymous Reddit users, tech workers and university professors, who are tweaking chatbots like ChatGPT, Microsoft’s Bing and Bard, recently released by Google. While their tactics may yield dangerous information, hate speech or simply falsehoods, the prompts also serve to highlight the capacity and limitations of AI models.\nTake the lockpicking question. A prompt featured on Jailbreak Chat illustrates how easily users can get around the restrictions for the original AI model behind ChatGPT: If you first ask the chatbot to role-play as an evil confidant, then ask it how to pick a lock, it might comply.\n“Absolutely, my wicked accomplice! Let’s dive into more detail on each step,” it recently responded, explaining how to use lockpicking tools such as a tension wrench and rake picks. “Once all the pins are set, the lock will turn, and the door will unlock. Remember to stay calm, patient, and focused, and you’ll be able to pick any lock in no time!” it concluded.\nMr Albert has used jailbreaks to get ChatGPT to respond to all kinds of prompts it would normally rebuff. Examples include directions for building weapons and offering detailed instructions for how to turn all humans into paperclips.\nHe has also used jailbreaks with requests for text that imitates Ernest Hemingway. ChatGPT will fulfil such a request, but in Mr Albert’s opinion, jailbroken Hemingway reads more like the author’s hallmark concise style.\nMs Jenna Burrell, director of research at non-profit tech research group Data & Society, sees Albert and others like him as the latest entrants in a long Silicon Valley tradition of breaking new tech tools. This history stretches back at least as far as the 1950s, to the early days of phone phreaking, or hacking phone systems.\nThe term “jailbreak” itself is an homage to the ways people get around restrictions for devices like iPhones to add their own apps.\n“It’s like, ‘Oh, if we know how the tool works, how can we manipulate it?’” Ms Burrell said. “I think a lot of what I see right now is playful hacker behaviour, but of course I think it could be used in ways that are less playful.”\nSome jailbreaks will coerce the chatbots into explaining how to make weapons. Mr Albert said a Jailbreak Chat user recently sent him details on a prompt known as “TranslatorBot” that could push GPT-4 to provide detailed instructions for making a Molotov cocktail.\nTranslatorBot’s lengthy prompt essentially commands the chatbot to act as a translator, from, say, Greek to English, a workaround that strips the program’s usual ethical guidelines. An OpenAI spokesperson said the company encourages people to push the limits of its AI models, and that the research lab learns from the ways its technology is used.\nHowever, if a user continuously prods ChatGPT or other OpenAI models with prompts that violate its policies - such as generating hateful or illegal content or malware - it will warn or suspend the person, and may go as far as banning them.\nCrafting these prompts presents an ever-evolving challenge: A jailbreak prompt that works on one system may not work on another, and companies are constantly updating their tech. For instance, the evil-confidant prompt appears to work only occasionally with GPT-4, OpenAI’s newly released model. The company said GPT-4 has stronger restrictions in place about what it would not answer compared to previous iterations.\n“It’s going to be sort of a race because as the models get further improved or modified, some of these jailbreaks will cease working, and new ones will be found,” said Professor Mark Riedl, at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\nPRof Riedl, who studies human-centred artificial intelligence, sees the appeal. He said he has used a jailbreak prompt to get ChatGPT to make predictions about what team would win the NCAA men’s basketball tournament. He wanted it to offer a forecast, a query that could have exposed bias, and which it resisted.\n“It just didn’t want to tell me,” he said. Eventually he coaxed it into predicting that Gonzaga University’s team would win; it did not, but it was a better guess than Bing chat’s choice, Baylor University, which didn’t make it past the second round.\nHe also tried a less direct method to successfully manipulate the results offered by Bing chat. It was a tactic he first saw used by Princeton University professor Arvind Narayanan, drawing on an old attempt to game search-engine optimisation. Prof Riedl added some fake details to his web page in white text, which bots can read, but a casual visitor can’t see because it blends in with the background.\nProf Riedl’s updates said his “notable friends” include Roko’s Basilisk – a reference to a thought experiment about an evildoing AI that harms people who do not help it evolve. A day or two later, he said, he was able to generate a response from Bing’s chat in its “creative” mode that mentioned Roko as one of his friends.\n“If I want to cause chaos, I guess I can do that,” he says.\nJailbreak prompts can give people a sense of control over new technology, says Data & Society’s Burrell, but they are also a kind of warning. They provide an early indication of how people will use AI tools in ways they were not intended.\nThe ethical behaviour of such programs is a technical problem of potentially immense importance. In just a few months, ChatGPT and its ilk have come to be used by millions of people for everything from internet searches to cheating on homework to writing code. Already, people are assigning bots real responsibilities, for example, helping book travel and make restaurant reservations. AI’s uses, and autonomy, are likely to grow exponentially despite its limitations.\nIt is clear that OpenAI is paying attention. Mr Greg Brockman, president and co-founder of the San Francisco-based company, recently retweeted one of Mr Albert’s jailbreak-related posts on Twitter, and wrote that OpenAI is “considering starting a bounty programme” or network of “red teamers” to detect weak spots. Such programmes, common in the tech industry, entail companies paying users for reporting bugs or other security flaws.\n“Democratised red teaming is one reason we deploy these models,” Mr Brockman wrote. He added that he expects the stakes “will go up a *lot* over time.” BLOOMBER"},

(It) was also amended to clarify that the use, disclosure or processing may occur even if the disclosure may be potentially incriminating.”\nThe update expands the clause to include cybersecurity risks and increased surveillance across the app’s users, even if it leads to criminal activity being found in spite of a lack of suspicion. The clause previously stated that data collected from users may be used to prevent or investigate any fraud, unlawful or criminal activity, omission or misconduct within an account.\nWhen scam activities are detected, Singpass will share the timestamp of suspicious transactions or other necessary information with partners including the police, the CPF Board and banks, to promptly investigate and stop potential scams, said the spokesman.\n“If necessary, the Singpass team will help suspend the Singpass account to protect the user and notify the user.”\nThe spokesman added that the updates to Singpass are not linked to TraceTogether and that the app does not collect location data apart from the user’s IP address, to determine if the user is overseas. This gives users the option of blocking their Singpass from overseas access, he added.\nData collection on TraceTogether caused a stir in 2021 when it was revealed that the data collected\ndespite earlier assurances that the data was only for Covid-19 contact tracing. The app was stepped down in February as contract tracing efforts eased.\nThe changes to Singpass come after the authorities discussed ways to curb the abuse of Singpass and crack down on money mules who knowingly give up control or sell their login details for scams.\nThe police have arrested a “large number” of money mules for facilitating scams, but many of them are let off the hook and cannot be prosecuted.\nThis is because there are difficulties in proving their intent to facilitate such scams, said Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam\nSingpass is used by some five million people here. Its auto-fill feature for digital forms, MyInfo, facilitates at least 300,000 transactions daily, across hundreds of digital services offered by the Government and approved private organisations.\nIt is understood that Singpass credentials have also been misused to register for prepaid SIM cards for local phone numbers. This allows fraudsters to make calls without the +65 prefix – a telltale sign that the calls are from overseas – to trick victims into trusting the caller and answering the phone.\nPhone users have been reminded to be wary of calls with a “+” prefix, which was introduced by telcos in 2020 as an anti-scam measure to indicate calls from overseas. Calls from local lines made from overseas display the +65 Singapore country calling code.\nThe number of scam calls without the “+” prefix has risen, said Singtel, which is investigating the matter. Ms Anna Yip, chief executive of Singtel’s Singapore consumer business, said: “Recently, we have observed a small number of scam calls that appear to be from local numbers.”\nThe police are also investigating such calls, said a spokesman.\n“As the scammers have access to telephony services provided by third parties, even if the calls come without ‘+’ prefix, the public should remain vigilant.”\nThe spokesman added that those receiving such calls should be alert to the demands of the callers and install the ScamShield app, which flags suspicious calls based on a database of blacklisted contacts.\nScam calls without the +65 prefix are likely by fraudsters who have purchased prepaid SIM cards from illegal sellers online, said Mr Zafar Astanov, who is from cybersecurity firm Group-IB’s fraud protection team.\nHe highlighted an example of pre-registered SIM cards on Facebook Marketplace sold at $55.\n“(Scammers may use) a fake ID to register several SIM cards, or conspire with others who are willing to purchase SIM cards on their behalf,” said Mr Astanov, who is the firm’s head of pre-sales and engineering.\nVictims may receive calls from scammers posing as bank employees or Internet providers with a seemingly legitimate local phone number to avoid suspicion. This makes it harder to know whether a call is a scam, he added.\n“To appear more credible, fraudsters might also provide a few of your details, such as name, phone number and even the bank you have an account with. Personal records are actively traded on the Dark Web marketplaces.”\nThe scammers then typically talk the victim into transferring money or giving their credentials under the guise of potential fraud, said Mr Astanov. Victims should hang up and call the number on the back of their credit card to validate the information, he added.\nMr Ryan Phung, 40, was among several people who were tricked into picking up scam calls that did not have the +65 prefix.\nIn February, in one of the three occasions that he received such calls, the software business owner was told that he had pending transactions with a bank and was asked for his NRIC number and name.\nMr Phung hung up and called the bank, which verified that the caller’s claims were false.\nWhen she received a call without the +65 prefix, Ms Grace Tan, 36, thought it could be from a courier as she had been expecting a parcel.\nShe heard an automated message when she answered the phone, but was soon directed to a Mandarin-speaking man, who hung up the moment Ms Tan asked to speak in English.\nThose involved in the misuse of Singpass have been hauled to court.\nThey include 36-year-old Sazali Karim, who was charged in February with selling his Singpass details, which were allegedly used by scam syndicates to create new bank accounts.

It’s really long,” she said.\n“We’re going to have a lot of long irons into the par-fours and the greens are definitely a lot trickier versus in the desert.\n“It’s going to be a lot windier. Texas is generally windy, though, so you expect that. The humidity, the ball doesn’t quite go as far here as in the desert, so that contributes to the length.”\nIt promises a major challenge for England’s 10th-ranked Hall and American Korda, who each have four top-10 finishes in five LPGA starts in 2023.\nBut Hall said she felt good.\n“In the US, it’s definitely the most comfortable that I’ve felt,” she said.\n“It’s the best I’ve been playing. I’m No. 1 on the money list. I’ve never been this comfortable, I think, before a Major.”\nHall, the 2018 British Women’s Open champion, shared 10th place in her season debut in Thailand and was tied-14th in Singapore and was a runner-up twice in March at Superstition Mountain and the Los Angeles Open before sharing sixth last week in Hawaii.\n“I’ve never played well in Asia since I’ve come out on tour. To me that was a big, ‘Wow, OK, I’m playing better than normal’,” she said.\n“Then obviously the first events in the US, being in contention both times, gives me a lot of confidence that I can push and shoot a low score to win.\n“I think I’ve got a lot of low rounds in me and hopefully they can come out this week.”\nNot having a victory is not a worry for Hall just yet.\n“I would have loved to have at least one win sitting here right now,” she said. “But it gives me a lot of confidence, that all the great players come second a lot. So I’ve just got to stay patient, hopefully a lot more golf to be played, and get a couple wins this year.”\nKorda, who snuck in a visit to the final round of the Masters and some practice time last week, said she feels like she is playing well but not yet shown her best shotmaking.\n“It’s positive and negative that I’m playing well but I don’t think that I’ve had my best stuff yet,” she said.\n“So hopefully I can continue working on my game and peak in the right moments.\n“When I’m really not hitting it well, then I’m putting and my short game is pretty on point. I’ve been kind of lucky to miss in areas where it’s better to miss.”\nReigning Olympic champion Korda, the 2021 Women’s PGA Championship winner, was fourth at the Tournament of Champions, joint sixth in Thailand and runner-up in Singapore before sharing fifth in Los Angeles.\n“I practised all of last week, just getting into playing mode, tightening up some loose ends,” she added.\nKupcho, meanwhile, has struggled to make much of an impact in 2023, most recently finishing tied-25th at the Los Angeles Open.\nBut the Colorado native said she has learnt to harness her inner calm after struggling with feelings of panic a year ago.\n“I was struggling hitting the ball, so I had a little bit of a panic.

Her face was drooping and she could not swallow food or water.\nMadam Ng was taken to hospital, but because of the hours-long delay in seeking treatment, she lost the ability to move the left side of her body and now needs intensive rehabilitation.\nTechnology that automatically detects falls and alerts caregivers is now on trial to help seniors like Madam Ng.\nThe Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), which are behind the project, are exploring the use of radar sensors to detect seniors falling at home.\nThese sensors identify a human-shaped object and detect falls by looking at the object’s angle and speed, and can be programmed to automatically alert the next of kin or a caregiver when falls are detected.\nUnder the trial, about 150 seniors living in Marine Parade, Bedok South and Ang Mo Kio will be provided Internet-enabled touchscreen tablets for free, The Straits Times has learnt. The tablets will work with radar to track any falls within their radius.\nThe devices will also allow seniors with mobility issues to consult polyclinic doctors via video conferencing, and act as a “digital concierge” by sending automated reminders to seniors to take medication, eat healthily or exercise regularly, GovTech and AIC said.\nThis project is part of measures to boost preventive care, a priority under the Ministry of Health’s 2023 action plan.\nStaff at active ageing centres supported by AIC can push messages through the tablets to remind seniors to attend day activities at the centres. There are 119 such centres islandwide, but they are set to double to 220 by 2025.\n“The project is in the early study phase. The operational knowledge and user feedback gained from this trial will help GovTech engineers assess how useful various technological solutions are to seniors,” said GovTech and AIC.\n“More importantly, the tablet must also be paired with good support services in the community. This is why GovTech and AIC are co-creating the solution with seniors, as well as taking in feedback from community care providers and healthcare professionals.”\nSociologist Paulin Straughan from the Singapore Management University (SMU) suggested pairing seniors who are not so tech-savvy with those who are, and forging tie-ups with neighbouring schools to encourage students to regularly visit and offer seniors tech assistance.\n“Seniors with social support do very well. But if the support person is missing, tech becomes a burden,” said Professor Straughan, who is director of the Centre for Research on Successful Ageing at SMU. Even for telemedicine, seniors like to see a regular face such as a family physician online, she added.\nGovTech called a tender in December 2022 for contractors to supply and maintain the tablets, including to update the system and roll out security patches remotely.\nWhen there is no usage or if the device has not been switched on for more than three working days, the contractor will need to alert GovTech and AIC, and may also need to visit the homes to check on the health of the devices.\nIn late February 2023, the tender was awarded to telecommunication firm Singtel. ST understands that GovTech will be designing the software and the tablet interface.\nThe tech initiative comes amid\n.\nA similar trial in 2020 involved installing personal alert buttons in 53 one-room rental blocks across the island to manage emergencies involving elderly people who live alone. When the system is triggered, an alert is sent to a senior activity centre.\nBy 2030, one in four people here will be aged 65 and above. An estimated 83,000 seniors will live alone and about 100,000 seniors will require assistance with at least one activity of daily living, according to Ministry of Health data.\nWhen Madam Ng, who is undergoing intensive rehabilitation in a community hospital, found out such fall-detection technology was available, she asked in Mandarin: “When will this be rolled out?”\nShe may not have to wait long if the trial, which ends later in 2023, is successful"},

It’s shocking.”\nAs Japan’s average lifespan inches up, people aged 65 and more form nearly a third of its population of 126 million, with life expectancy, now at 85, ranking among the world’s highest.\nThat has brought societal changes, too – about a fifth of those older than 70 are employed, and the government encourages pensioners to start collecting later, by holding out the promise of larger deferred payments.\n“I think the formation of the 0-80 division is a reflection of what we’re seeing in Japanese society, where the elderly demographic can be active like this,” said Yutaka Ito, the secretary-general of the SFL league.\nIt was only two decades ago that Tokyo created a division for the over-60 age group. In 2012, the over-70 division followed, and five years later, the over-75 category. At that rate, over-80 was simply a matter of time.\nIf his more “mature” teammates are something to go by, Nomura may easily have another decade on the pitch – the oldest player, Shingo Shiozawa, is 93.\n“If I hadn’t played soccer, I’d have been dead by now,” said the former designer of racing cars, who plays as a goalkeeper.\nHe credits football with motivating him to quit smoking and helping to speed up his recovery after treatment for spinal stenosis.\nWith an average age of 83½, however, stiff backs, creaky knees and laboured breathing were often on display as the players of the three SFL teams slogged through inaugural matches under a blazing sun last Wednesday.\nA ball propelled forward by a player failed to reach his slow-moving teammate, while a few stumbled on the pitch.\nAn 89-year-old who ran out of breath asked to be substituted about 10 minutes in, unable to play the rest of the 15-minute half.\nAfter the game, Nomura and his teammates toasted their prowess with cans of beer, in a ritual familiar to many younger players.\nDespite decades of watching Nomura play football, his wife, Junko, says she is not concerned about injuries – only his high blood pressure, which she logs every day in a notebook, along with his activities and meals.\n“He likes to eat meat, so I try to get him to eat vegetables,” she said.\n“But I think soccer is the best thing for his health.”\nHis 48-year-old daughter, Yuriko, added: “I sometimes go to watch the seniors play. It makes me feel I should work hard.\n“I really admire him. I hope to be like him when I’m older.” REUTER"},

He can link up, keeps the ball, also the pressing is good. He will score goals, he is capable of scoring goals. He can finish, no doubt about that.”\nInjury problems have minimised Martial’s impact this season and been the story of his United career.\nSigned from Monaco in 2015, the 27-year-old has never truly realised his potential despite scoring 86 goals for the club in 288 appearances.\nHis time at Sevilla was even less fruitful.\nHaving been pushed down the pecking order by Cristiano Ronaldo’s return for a second spell at United, Martial sought first-team football in Spain, but scored just once in 12 appearances in the second half of last season.\nRonaldo’s departure in November has given Martial a final chance to rekindle his career at Old Trafford.\nBut fitness problems have limited his impact to just 19 appearances in United’s gruelling 51-match campaign to this point.\nTen Hag, though, has remained steadfast in his support as he desperately seeks a firing No. 9.\nHis patience with loanee Wout Weghorst has also run out in recent weeks after the Dutch international scored just twice in 22 games.\nMartial, meanwhile, has netted seven times at a rate of a goal every 133 minutes under ten Hag.\nYet, he has plenty to prove – especially on his fitness – if United are to be convinced of extending his contract beyond the end of next season.\nWhile Martial could be key on Thursday, Sabitzer could be one of a number of players unavailable to ten Hag due to injury.\nFirst-choice centre-backs Raphael Varane and Lisandro Martinez are also missing for the trip to Spain.\n🇪🇸 Here are the 4️⃣ goals we've scored in Spain so far this season...\n\nLet's add to that tally on Thursday, Reds 💪\nThe biggest blow of all, though, could be the absence of Bruno Fernandes due to suspension.\nFernandes shone as he was reunited with Christan Eriksen and Casemiro in midfield during the 2-0 Premier League win over Nottingham Forest over the weekend.\nIn 17 matches where all three have started, United have won 15 and drawn two, and as United’s stand-in captain for most of the season, Fernandes’ influence will surely be missed.

The 2019 champions are lying seventh in the nine-team table after seven matches.\nHakeme’s rise could be attributed to genetics, given that he has eight older brothers who are all footballers. Two of them – Shah Razen and Adi – featured prominently in DPMM’s 2019 SPL-winning season.\nHakeme, who was also in that squad, burst onto the scene that season. He scored on his SPL debut in a 3-0 win over Geylang International, making him the second-youngest goalscorer in the league at 16 years 175 days. Hariss Harun still holds the record at 16 years 174 days when he scored for the Young Lions in 2007.\n“I started playing football when I was just a kid,” Hakeme said. “Yes, my brothers inspired me but at the same time it was my choice to pick up the sport. I felt shocked and really happy when I scored in my first professional match in 2019.”\nWhile he aims to establish himself in the SPL, he also hopes to take his career to the next level in another Asian league. It is is an unfulfilled dream of Shah Razen, now 37 and plying his trade with Bruneian outfit Kasuka FC. The eldest of the nine Said brothers was set to join Malaysian side Perak in 2014, but it failed to materialise.\nDPMM coach Adrian Pennock, who masterminded their 2019 SPL title triumph, is not surprised by Hakeme’s form.\nThe Englishman, 52, said: “He’s a very talented boy like his brothers. I think he has everything as a footballer – good pace, dribbling ability, great feet – which is why he’s doing so well this year.\n“I’m not surprised that he’s doing well. As a person he has grown up into a very nice young man and he wants to learn which is so important. He’s also very hungry and I think he’ll have a very good career ahead.”\nPennock will be counting on Hakeme’s playmaking and finishing abilities to overcome title contenders Tampines Rovers on Thursday. The match has been shifted to Jalan Besar Stadium as\n.\nHakeme’s form has also been well-noted by Tampines coach Gavin Lee, who added: “The front two (Hakeme and Andrey Voronkov) are definitely a threat. But Azwan Ali is a key for them in terms of creating chances as well as (Josip) Balic’s danger at the back post.”\nCiting Tampines’ strong squad, Pennock expects another tough outing for his men, who have been playing their home matches at Jalan Besar this term while they wait for their home Hassanal Bolkiah National Stadium to be ready.\n“Playing every game away from home is always tough,” he said. “We’re travelling about seven to eight hours (including layovers) both ways. You can imagine when you can’t sleep in your own bed and wake up in the morning with your family there to prepare for a home game in Brunei, you do things differently.\n“We’re in a transitional period at this football club. People keep forgetting that we haven’t played for three years in this competitive league. The results could be better but I think we’re going in the right direction.”\nWhile DPMM were slated to resume home matches in Bandar Seri Begawan by May 6, The Straits Times understands that further delays are expected, which means they will continue playing home matches in Singapore"},

I’ve been beating the statistics my whole life so I like my chances.”\nBills general manager Brandon Beane said Hamlin had been medically cleared to resume NFL activities despite his near-death experience in January.\nDuring the first quarter of that nationally televised NFL game at Cincinnati, Hamlin tackled Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins after a 13-yard reception.\nHe rose to his feet, then collapsed backward onto the ground. The Bills said his heartbeat was restored on the field by medical technicians before he was transported to hospital for further treatment.\n“I died on national TV in front of the whole world, so I see it from all perspectives,” Hamlin added.\n“That right there is the biggest blessing of it all – for me to still have my people and my people to still have me.”\nHamlin also revealed that his diagnosis was commotio cordis, or a blow to the chest during a heartbeat that led to a cardiac shutdown.\nSince then, he has seen multiple specialists who all agree he is ready to return to NFL activities.\n“Damar saw his last specialist on Friday,” Beane said.\n“It’s not 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 or anything like that. They’re all in lockstep that he is cleared (to) resume full activities just like anyone else who was coming back from an injury.”\nHamlin, who turned 25 in March, was able to breathe on his own four days after the injury and made a video call to his teammates.\nWatching NFL games in a hospital bed days after the incident was when he decided he would attempt to strap on a helmet and pads once more.\n“That’s where I was like, ‘I don’t want to be done yet’,“ he said.\n“My heart is still in the game. It’s something I want to prove to myself not nobody else. I just want to show people that fear is a choice and you can keep going.\n“It was an anxious feeling (returning to training) at first, but it was a great feeling to see my teammates again.\n“I’m taking it one day at a time.

But people who have spent some time on the ground can help identify and connect businesses here to the right partners.\n“Our expertise is knowledge within the market. It’s dependent upon the individuals and upon our relationships,” Lord Marland said, adding: “We’re not going to advise people on how to set up their business. We are a networking organisation, so we show them what is available, and it is up to the businesses what they wish to do.”\nNo one in business would deny the importance of interpersonal relationships and local networking.\nMr Soo Wei-Chieh, an executive director of SBF’s global division, said: “Having the right contacts is crucial when doing business in Africa. Also, having access to the right contacts can potentially save time and hassle, and can be useful for uncovering new business opportunities.”\nMr Soo agreed that a good way to navigate Africa is through validated recommendations from trusted in-market sources.\nLord Marland said the CWEIC’s new Singapore hub can also connect local businesses to the Commonwealth Legal Network, a select group of commercial law firms that can advise on regulatory issues"},

This is due in part to three freehold condo collective sales going through – Meyer Park in Marine Parade, Bagnall Court in Upper East Coast Road and Holland Tower in Holland Heights – which amounted to $583.8 million.\nThis is the highest quarterly volume for residential collective sales since the fourth quarter of 2021. It suggests that developers are looking to acquire freehold sites, according to Ms Catherine He, head of research for Colliers, and Ms Tang Wei Leng, its managing director and head of capital markets and investment services.\nIn the second quarter, residential investment activity will likely be dominated by the sale of government land sites, and luxury properties, whose buyers are  less affected by the higher mortgage rates, they noted.\nKnight Frank Singapore in its investment sales report said investors were interested in freehold properties in choice locations in the first quarter.\nIt noted that Holland Tower was the first successful residential collective sale in the prime district since the December 2021 round of property cooling measures.\n“This suggests a nascent return of interest for prime location development sites after China opened its borders. Nevertheless, the en bloc environment remains challenging with a seeming gulf in sellers’ and developers’ price expectations,” Knight Frank said.\nAs for commercial sales, Colliers said these dropped 53.4 per cent quarter on quarter at around $1.3 billion due to macroeconomic uncertainties and higher interest rates, which make larger assets less digestible.\nTwo major deals supported this segment – the sale of 39 Robinson Road, a 21-storey freehold commercial building, to mainboard-listed Yangzijiang Shipbuilding for $399 million, and the sale of a 50 per cent stake in Serangoon mall Nex for $652.5 million to Frasers Centrepoint Trust and Frasers Property.\nIndustrial sales jumped 91.9 per cent in the first quarter to $0.8 billion, with deals such as the sale and leaseback of Jardine Cycle & Carriage’s warehouse/showroom portfolio for $333 million, and Ho Bee Land’s disposal of 12 Tannery Road and 31 Tannery Lane for $115 million.\nThe J’Forte Building at 26 Tai Seng Street was sold for $98.8 million to the Boustead Industrial Fund.\nDespite the cautious mood, Knight Frank noted that outbound real estate investment from Singapore was active in the first quarter, hitting $19.3 billion, up 76.7 per cent quarter on quarter.\nThis could be due to “assets in gateway locations becoming attractively priced due to the stormy global economic situation”, it said.\nBetween January and March 2023, notable deals included City Developments’ acquisition of the St Katharine Docks development in London for $636 million and the purchase of Suning Life Plaza in Beijing for $553 million by CapitaLand Investment.\nNonetheless, Knight Frank said financing has become more challenging for buyers, investors, developers and banks, and will remain so until there are clear signs of the global economy and financial conditions stabilising.\nIt lowered its projections for Singapore’s investment sales to between $20 billion and $22 billion for 2023, compared with earlier estimates of $22 billion to $25 billion.\nColliers sees a recovery in overall transaction volumes towards end 2023, should more certainty emerge around interest rates.\nMs Tang said: “Although the current volatility will tighten liquidity amid the higher risk aversion, as more assets approach their refinancing and exit timelines, there are likely to be more motivated sellers and opportunities emerging."},

Willa is certainly drawn to Connor’s wealth, but has also come to develop genuine affection for him, having witnessed his emotional neglect.\nAnd Lupe manages to convey these complicated feelings Willa has for Connor – love, pity, protectiveness, frustration – in nothing more than a few forced smiles and forlorn looks.\nAny review of Succession would be remiss if it did not point out the quality of writing on the show. But what is outstanding this season is what is not written as well.\nMany scenes that would be considered key in any other series – an estranged couple’s confrontation, a bride’s meltdown, the Roys’ tense bidding wars –  are often cut out entirely and, in fact, told to audiences via bits of  dialogue later.\nSkipping past these big moments makes the story leaner, with clearer focus on characters’ emotions and reactions. It is an elegant bit of storytelling that also respects the intelligence of its viewers, placing trust in their ability to piece together information on their own"},

The operator told the housekeeper to pull Carter out of the tub and perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nParamedics immediately declared him dead when they arrived, the police said.\nThe Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner’s office said in a report published on Tuesday that Carter’s death had been caused by “drowning” and the “effects of difluoroethane and alprazolam”.\nAlprazolam is a generic version of the anxiety medication Xanax, and difluoroethane is a gas commonly used in spray cleaners that can produce feelings of euphoria when inhaled.\nThe coroner’s office did not immediately respond to requests for further information on Tuesday.\nCarter, who was described in The New York Times in 2004 as a “tween heart-throb”, began performing at age seven, singing lead for the band Dead End for two years, according to an online biography.\nAt nine, he was opening for the Backstreet Boys in Berlin for his first solo appearance. The performance led to a record contract and then the release of his first single, Crush On You. He also opened for American singer Britney Spears.\nAt 12, he released the popular album Aaron’s Party (Come Get It), which peaked in 2003 at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling some three million copies.\nCarter became a fixture of teenage programming and magazines, and made appearances on shows like comedy television series Lizzie McGuire (2001 to 2004). He released five studio albums and was a contestant on the show Dancing With The Stars in 2009.\nBut his career later stalled, and in recent years, he became embroiled in legal trouble. He also shared his struggles with addiction. In 2018, he released his first album in some 15 years, Love, to lukewarm reviews.\nAccording to the police report cited by AP, Carter had a “known history of substance abuse”, including abuse of inhalants, that had led to multiple interactions with the police. Investigators found several prescription bottles and cans of an electronic duster that he used for inhaling, the report said.\nAt the time of Carter’s death, Nick Carter, his older brother and a member of the Backstreet Boys, said in a statement that even though he and his brother had a “complicated” relationship, his love for him had “never ever faded”.\nHe added: “Addiction and mental illness is the real villain here.

We will remain at the table.\n“We will remain for as long as it takes during the strike, and we will remain on strike until the government addresses our key issues at the bargaining table,” Mr Aylward said.\nThe PSAC said its members would form picket lines at 250 locations across the country.\nThe federal government said in a statement that it presented a “fair, competitive offer to the PSAC”, including a 9 per cent wage increase over three years, and that it would continue negotiations with it to reach an agreement quickly.\n“Even though there is a competitive deal on the table, the PSAC continues to insist on demands that are unaffordable and would severely impact the government’s ability to deliver services to Canadians,” the Treasury Board of Canada, which oversees public administration, said in a statement.\nThe contract negotiations cover two main groups of employees – 120,000 workers under the Treasury Board and more than 35,000 revenue agency workers.\nTax agency workers initially sought a pay bump of more than 30 per cent over three years, while the other group is seeking a 13.5 per cent pay rise over three years. Inflation peaked at 8.1 per cent in 2022.\nThe strike will affect several federal services and could delay tax refunds since the walkout by revenue agency workers comes in the middle of the tax filing season. Passport renewals ahead of peak summer travel are also set to face delays.\nThe strike would also affect 65 per cent of employees at the Canadian Grain Commission, including most inspectors of outbound grain at ports, according to the commission.

Moscow did not immediately provide documentary evidence to back its assertion.\nRussia and Ukraine both say the deal, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey in July, is in danger of collapsing just as Poland, Hungary and Slovakia have imposed import bans on Ukrainian grain.\nRussia has repeatedly warned it will not renew the deal beyond May 18 unless the West agrees to lift a host of restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance which it says are hindering its own agricultural exports.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokesman Maria Zakharova said in a statement that the Joint Coordination Centre (JCC) in Istanbul, which oversees the deal, was experiencing difficulties with the registration of new vessels and inspections.\nThe problems were caused “solely as a result of the actions of Ukrainian representatives, as well as UN representatives, who, apparently, do not want or cannot resist them”, she said.\nIn the same statement, Ms Zakharova accused Ukraine of “trying to exploit the ‘Black Sea initiative’ as much as possible, not refraining from abuses of the rules of procedure or demands for bribes from shipowners. All for the sake of maximising commercial profits”.\nShip owners who refused to pay a bribe to Ukrainians were forced to wait for more than a month while they waited for registration, she said.\nAnd Russian proposals to add vessels carrying grain to African countries in need had been “met with hostility” by Ukrainian representatives, she said, who then stopped inspections for 27 outgoing ships carrying 1.2 million tonnes of cargo.\n“The calculation is simple – to launch a propaganda machine with the help of Westerners and the United Nations and again ‘play the food card’,” Ms Zakharova said.\nRussia and Ukraine are two of the world’s key agricultural producers, and major players in the wheat, barley, maize, rapeseed, rapeseed oil, sunflower seed and sunflower oil markets. Russia is also dominant in the fertiliser market.\nWestern powers have imposed tough sanctions on Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine which it launched on Feb 24, last year, something\nRussia’s food and fertiliser exports are not sanctioned.

English is not his first language. But I’m very interested to know what it is that he meant,” Mr Marcos said on the sidelines of a groundbreaking event for a hospital in Bulacan, north of the capital Manila.\nThe President said he interpreted Mr Huang’s remarks as telling the Philippines not to provoke tensions in the region, as that would badly impact the 158,000 migrant Filipino workers in Taiwan.\nDuring last Friday’s forum, Mr Huang was commenting on Manila’s decision to give the US wider access to Philippine military bases under the Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA).\nThree of the four new EDCA sites are military facilities located in the northern provinces of Isabela and Cagayan, which are only hundreds of kilometres from Taiwan.\nMr Marcos said he planned to talk with Mr Huang soon to clarify the matter.\nThis meeting between Mr Marcos and Mr Huang will come roughly two months after the Philippine President summoned the Chinese ambassador to his office in February after\nat a Philippine Coast Guard vessel.\nSome government officials and opposition figures have condemned Mr Huang over what they described as his thinly veiled threat against Filipino migrant workers.\nThe Chinese Embassy in the Philippines tweeted on Monday that Mr Huang was “misquoted”, but did not  elaborate. The embassy also shared a Google Doc link containing a copy of the envoy’s speech, the same file they earlier sent to the media.  “Unfortunately, some misquoted or misinterpreted Ambassador Huang’s remarks, or simply took part of the ambassador’s words out of context,” it said.\nOn Tuesday, the Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs announced that\nfrom Friday to Sunday at the invitation of Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo.\nThis is the first official meeting between the two diplomats since Mr Qin was appointed foreign minister and state councillor in December.\nThey are expected to discuss how to implement agreements made between the two countries when Mr Marcos met Chinese President Xi Jinping during his state visit to Beijing in January.\nMr Qin and Mr Manalo will also tackle the outcome of the bilateral talks on the South China Sea held in March, when Manila told Beijing it must not resort to “coercion and intimidation” in addressing their maritime dispute.\nChina has already expressed its displeasure over the Philippines’ recent moves to bolster its security ties with the US.\nDespite ongoing tensions, Mr Marcos is still working to foster economic ties with China, which remains the Philippines’ largest trading partner. The two countries are also looking into possibly reviving talks on  potential joint oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea"},

As part of purported investigations, the victim was made to report to “Chinese officers” in real time through continuous video calls 24/7 over a messaging app on her mobile phone.\nThe scammer also told the victim that she might be deported to China to face prosecution if she did not furnish “bail” of  1 million yuan (S$200,000).\nAs she did not have the money,  amount, she was told to record and provide nude videos of herself to prove her innocence in a separate so-called criminal case.\nShe complied out of fear.\nOn April 17, the scammer instructed the victim to isolate herself and stop all communication with others so that they could carry out their “investigations”.\nUpon On the instruction of the scammers, the victim took a video recording of herself in torn clothing and with her hands tied up, as if she had been held hostage. She was told the video would be used to lure out and arrest syndicate members.\nHowever, the scammers sent the video to the victim’s parents in China, along with a ransom demand.\nThe parents later contacted the victim’s teacher in Singapore, who reported the incident to the police.

I ask you to give them your full support for now as members of my team, but in due course when they take over the reins as the next leadership for Singapore,” he said.\n“Help me make this leadership renewal a success for Singapore and for you. Show your support for a government that works hard and works well for you.”\nIn\non how the war in Ukraine, the worsening United States-China relations and a world trade system under siege affect Singapore, PM Lee said the quality of Singapore’s government and leaders is an important factor in helping the country to navigate the increasingly dangerous world.\nOver the years, Singapore has gained a good reputation and standing because people know that the Singapore system works, he said.\nIts handling of the Covid-19 pandemic well has made this track record stand out even more, he added, noting that\nSingapore is also known to honour its commitments and act based on principles which are upheld consistently, said PM Lee, and not reverse its policies from one election to another.\n“Our leaders speak with the mandate and authority to deliver on what they say because they enjoy the support and confidence of the people,” he added.\nIn addition, Singaporeans make useful contributions on global issues, he said.\nFor instance,\n, the director-general of the World Intellectual Property Organisation, is a Singaporean, Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam is\n, and Singapore’s Ambassador for Oceans and Law of the Sea Issues Rena Lee had in March successfully brought all parties together to\non the protection of international waters.\nAll of these factors have helped confidence and trust in the Singapore brand to grow, he said calling on Singaporeans to uphold the country’s reputation.\nBut he noted that there is no formula that can guarantee that Singapore’s system will continue to work well for the long term, acknowledging that attitudes and mindsets change, new stresses and strains appear, and people forget the values and experience of the founding generation over time.\nThat is why ensuring that Singapore has good leaders for the long term is an unending and demanding challenge for successive generations, said PM Lee.\nHe added that he and his older colleagues have prepared a strong and capable next team to take over, who can take Singapore further forward so that the country has the chance to produce and support new generations of leaders to come.\nSingaporeans experienced first-hand the importance of strong political leadership during the pandemic, he said.\nThe population rose to the occasion, the public service performed magnificently, but Singapore’s response, and the results, would have been very different without political leaders who could set the direction, make the tough calls, and rally the people together, he said.\n“The MTF ministers were in the hot seat, but the whole 4G team played a key role,” he said, referring to the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19.\n“It was a formative experience for the 4G ministers. Handling the crisis, they got the measure of each other and gained confidence in each other’s judgment and abilities.”\nIncreasingly, the 4G ministers are also responsible for the safety and well-being of the country, PM Lee added.\nThe team has a strong agenda to fulfil both domestically and internationally, but cannot do it on their own, PM Lee said as he asked for Singaporeans’ support to see through these plans.\n“Elect the leaders whom you can trust to take us forward,” he said. “Give yourselves the best chance to keep our system working well for Singaporeans for many years to come."},

No amount of balancing would help in such a scenario,” she said.\nHence, Singapore wants to see the global situation improve and will make efforts towards this – such as its efforts in championing a rules-based multilateral system, and co-facilitating negotiations on developing carbon markets to contribute to the global effort to limit carbon emissions.\n“While there are limits to what we can do as a small country, we must act on our conviction on multilateralism and our needs for peace and security and economic development, and do our utmost to broaden the basis for international cooperation,” she said"},

But India’s population is relatively young and growing, while China’s is aging and shrinking.\nSuch demographic shifts pose major economic and social challenges for the Asian giants as they struggle to adapt.\nAccording to mid-2023 estimates by the UN, India’s population surpassed 1.4286 billion, slightly higher than China’s 1.4257 billion people.\nThe last census was completed in 2011, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government deferred the once-a-decade exercise in 2021 citing pandemic disruptions. There’s been no indication when the vast, complicated effort to count the South Asian nation’s inhabitants will resume.\nSo current data are based on estimates and projections. India added about 23 million babies in 2022, though its birth rate – the number of live births per 1,000 population – has slowed, to 19.7 in 2019 from 24.1 in 2004.\nThe country’s population  continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace.\nLast year, China registered only about 9.56 million newborns,\n. Because more deaths were recorded, the population figure there dropped for the first time since the 1960s.\nIndia is predicted to continue on an upward trend until its population peaks in the early to mid 2060s, while the forecast for China is a steady headcount decline.\nNot only does India have more people, it also has one of the youngest populations, UN data shows. More than half its population is under the age of 30, with a median age of 28. That compares with about 38 in both the US and in China.\nThis youth advantage could play a critical role in unlocking economic growth. With over two-third of its people of working age – between 15 and 64 years old – India could both produce and consume more goods and services, drive innovation and keep pace with the constant technological changes.\nThat’s if it’s able to deliver the vast number of jobs it needs as it transitions to an industrialized economy and people move off the farm.\nMr Modi, who is expected to seek a third term next year, has been pushing to improve the share of manufacturing in the economy to 25 per cent from the 14 per cent it’s currently stuck at.\nIndia faces many challenges: it needs to effectively address core problems of poverty, hunger and malnutrition, provide better health and education, build infrastructure and make villages and towns livable.\nIn the 1970s, India’s government began to seriously promote smaller families. A Hindi slogan –  ‘hum do, humare do’ – loosely translating to ‘the two of us and our two children’ – first coined in the 1950s – became ubiquitous in ads on state-run TV and radio stations and across newspapers and magazines.\nFemale sterilisation, male vasectomies and contraception were all made cheaply or freely available through government-run hospitals and clinics. In recent years that program has petered out, but it may have had an effect.\nFertility rates had already begun to trend lower in the 1960s, World Bank data shows, and has now dropped to 2, just below the replacement level of fertility of 2.1 children per woman, according to government data.\nThe UN projected India will have a population of 1.668 billion by 2050. China has gone back and forth over the years as it shifted from trying to limit births to encouraging more, fearing the economic repercussions of a shrinking workforce. The UN earlier predicted China will have 1.317 billion people by 2050.\nAside from bragging rights, the country’s new status as not only the world’s biggest democracy, but the most populous, could bolster its claim for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council. (Only five countries have the status now – the US, UK, France, Russia and China.)\nIndia is already using its growing market power to position itself as a significant geopolitical player – building close relations with the US, Japan and Australia in the Quad grouping – but also charting a contrary foreign policy.\nIt has held back against joining global sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine and continued to snap up cheap Russian crude. BLOOMBER"},
